Contents  [hide] 1 History2 Academic structures3 Academic programs4 Notable alumni and faculty5 References6 External linksHistory[edit]The Ukrainian Free University (UFU) was established in Vienna, January 17, 1921.
The idea to organize a Ukrainian university-in-exile came from Ukrainian academics, some of whom had held chairs at universities in the Russian and Austro-Hungarian Empires.
The host government granted UFU full academic accreditation and provided the University with financial support.
UFU received wide recognition during its Prague period for significant and productive teaching, research and publications.
In the ensuing period various Bavarian university laws and ministerial decrees reaffirmed this academic privilege.
Federal German and Bavarian governmental financial support contributed towards worthwhile research, publishing and teaching activities.
The University became a recognized Western European scholarly centre, specializing in the study of Ukraine within the USSR and of Ukrainians in the diaspora.
German and Bavarian financial aid ceased in the years following Ukrainian independence, as it was assumed that patronage of the University would be assured by Ukraine.
Over the years, the University has evolved from a "university-in-exile" to a full-fledged, though highly specialized, European Union graduate school.
The Faculty of Philosophy houses the remaining humanitarian disciplines, such as philosophy, fine arts, music, teacher training and religion.
The Faculty of Government and Political Economy unites such social science disciplines as political science, economics and business, sociology, psychology and legal studies.
Academic programs[edit]UFU is the only private university in the world which, while located outside of Ukraine, offers graduate programs of study in the social sciences and the humanities, primarily in Ukrainian language.
Doctoral programs stipulate three semesters of course work, a doctoral dissertation, philosophy commprehensives and an oral thesis defense.
Winter Semester teaching period runs from early November to mid December and from the end of January until early March.
Most UFU faculty members also hold simultaneously permanent academic positions at European Union, American, Canadian and Ukrainian institutions of higher learning.

Today it houses the rector's office and some parts of the university administration as well as a baroque assembly hall.
As Greifswald is a small, coastal student town, the relationship between the university and the town has mostly been close.
For instance, it was Heinrich Rubenow, then Lord Mayor of the city, who pushed for the establishment of a university in his town, and who became the university's first rector in the year 1456.
The University of Greifswald (German pronunciation: [ˈɡʁaɪfsvalt]; German: Ernst-Moritz-Arndt-Universität Greifswald) is a public research university located in Greifswald, Germany, in the state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
Founded in 1456 (teaching existed since 1436), it is one of the oldest universities in Europe, with generations of notable alumni and staff having studied or worked in Greifswald.
As the fourth-oldest university in present Germany, it was temporarily also the oldest university of the Kingdoms of Sweden (1648–1815) and Prussia (1815–1945), respectively.
Due to the small-town atmosphere, the pronounced architectural presence of the alma mater across town, and the young, academic flair in the streets, Greifswald is often described as a "university with a town built around it" rather than a town with a university.
5 Fraternities6 Notable people7 Quotes8 Literature9 See also10 References11 External linksHistory[edit]1456—1600: Founding[edit] This section does not cite any sources.
The University of Greifswald was founded on 17 October 1456 with the approval of the Holy Roman Empire and the Pope.
This was possible due to the great commitment of Greifswald's lord mayor, Heinrich Rubenow, who was also to become the university's first rector, with the support of Duke Wartislaw IX of Pomerania and Bishop Henning Iven of the local St Nicolas' Cathedral.
The founding took place in the local cathedral, which was later remodeled by Caspar David Friedrich and his brother and can still be visited today.
The founding of the university was made possible by a decree that restricted teaching activity at the University of Rostock (founded 1419).
Several professors left Rostock for Greifswald to continue their work there, where Heinrich Rubenow took the chance of establishing his own university.
Originally, the university consisted of the four traditional divisions: Theology, Philosophy, Medicine and Law.
In Germany, there are only three older universities by count of the years of existence: the University of Heidelberg (established 1386), the University of Leipzig (1409), and the University of Rostock (1419).
International co-operation with other institutions of higher education in northern Europe existed already in the earliest years, sparked and accelerated by the transnational trading network Hanse.
From 1456 until 1526, 476 Scandinavians were enrolled at Greifswald University and 22 faculty members as well as six rectors came from Scandinavia.
The early sixteenth century saw significant co-operation of the university, the Lutheran church, the city and the Duchy of Pomerania.
Professors of law where also working at the local courts while professors of the faculty of philosophy usually taught the sons and daughters of the ducal family.
Johannes Bugenhagen, an alumnus of the university, was an important figure during the German and Scandinavian reformation as well as a good friend of Martin Luther.
After the secularisation of the monastery at Eldena near Greifswald, Duke Philipp I of Pomerania gave all revenue created by the now secularised Amt Eldena to the university.
His successor, Duke Ernst Ludwig, began the construction of a college building, which could only be completed after his death.
Duke Philipp Julius presented the university a gown that was used by the rector on ceremonial occasions up until very recently.
1600—1815: Sweden[edit]In 1604, the Greifswald University Library became the first centralised university library in Germany.
Hence, the university now owns prestigious early prints of authors and printers such as Johannes Gutenberg or Thomas Thorild.
The phrase cuius regio, eius religio as applied to the outcome of the Protestant Reformation is attributed to the early seventeenth century jurist Joachim Stephani (1544–1623) of the University of Greifswald.
After the Peace of Westphalia in 1648 the western part of Pomerania, including Greifswald and its university, became a fief held by Sweden.
Without entirely losing its character as a German university, it was heavily influenced by Swedish educational policies until 1815.
Especially during the second half of the eighteenth century Greifswald was a cultural and scientific bridge between Germany and Sweden.
The main administrative building - still in use today - was built during the "good old Swedish years" by Andreas Mayer, a mathematician by profession, in the style of North German Baroque.
(June 2011) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)   The renowned Romanticist painter Caspar David Friedrich immortalised the city in several of his paintings, e.
The Rubenow-Denkmal (Rubenow Memorial) was erected in 1856 for celebration of the 400th anniversary of the university in honour of its founder and first rector, Heinrich Rubenow.
When Swedish Pomerania became part of the Kingdom of Prussia in 1815, the University of Greifswald became the oldest university on Prussian territory.
Prussia recognised the potential of science and universities, thus extensive building activity and growing financial support enabled the University of Greifswald to grow further both in size and reputation.
In 1856, on the occasion of the 400th anniversary of the university's founding, a monument was unveiled in the presence of King Frederick William IV of Prussia.
To commemorate the 400th anniversary of the university 1456—1856, the "Rubenow-Denkmal" (Rubenow Memorial) was built in front of the main building, which is still there at its historic place.
The painter Caspar David Friedrich was born in Greifswald and received his first painting instruction by one of the university's members.
1933—1945: Nazi Germany[edit]Main article: University education in Nazi GermanyIn 1933 the university was named after Ernst Moritz Arndt, who was a student of theology in 1791 and later taught history at Greifswald.
Here, he published his works "Versuch einer Geschichte der Leibeigenschaft in Pommern und Rügen", "Germanien und Europa" as well as the first part of "Geist der Zeit".
Several organisational changes were made during the time of the GDR, most of which were revoked in the 1990s after the German Reunification.
1990—today: Germany[edit]Freedom of science as well as the autonomy and self-administration of the university were re-established.
The dinosaur Emausaurus was named after the acronym of the university (Erndt-Moritz-Arndt-Universität Greifswald) in 1990.
Beginning in 1999, the University of Greifswald was among the first in Germany to welcome and introduce the international Bachelor/Master degree system as proposed by the Bologna declaration.
The central ceremony – involving the re-opening of the university's renovated administrative building by President Horst Köhler of Germany, Queen Silvia of Sweden, and Minister President Harald Ringstorff of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern – took place on 17 October 2006.
Between 1991 and 2007, more than 417 million Euros were spent on the careful renovation of historic buildings, as well as on the construction of new sites.
For instance, 19th century lecture hall ("auditorium maximum") has been carefully restored, just like the university's main administrative building and many other buildings in the historic center of town.
A new campus for natural sciences (physics, chemistry, biochemistry), medicine, IT and mathematics is under construction in the eastern part of the city.
The new domiciles of Greifswald University Library, the departments of physics, biology and biochemistry have already been completed.
The university hospital, which is thought to be completed in 2009, will be the most up-to-date full-scale hospital in Germany, adding to the appeal of the Greifswald Medical School.
There have been frequent debates as to whether Arndt's name is desirable for the university or not, but attempts to change the university's name have always been rejected.
The rector is elected by the senate for a six-year term, the chancellor for an eight-year term, and the two vice rectors are elected to serve for two years.
The senate consists of scientific staff members (divided into professors and non-professors), students, and non-scientific staff members (librarians, administration officials, etc.
Moreover, there is a university council (Universitätsrat), consisting of six prominent members of the public who are elected by the senate to advise the university in various ways.
Faculties[edit]The old campus with its many ivy-covered historic buildings was mostly built during the Swedish and Prussian era, and the newly built Physics Dept is an example of the growing new science campus.
As more and more departments and clinics of the medical faculty and the faculty of natural sciences and mathematics move to new science campus, many of the skillfully built historic buildings in the city centre are renovated and prepared for use by the other faculties.
The buildings of the arts and humanities, law, business studies, and theology are scattered about the historic center of the City of Greifswald.
The newly built facilities for the natural sciences, mathematics, medicine, pharmacy, dentistry are situated to the east of the city centre, offering top-standard research opportunities.
Like many European universities, Greifswald University is separated into five faculties (German: Fakultät) and among those further subdivided into departments (Institut).
Mathematics and Natural Sciences[edit]Courses are offered in biology, chemistry, biochemistry, geography, geology, Mathematics, IT, pharmacy and physics.
Since 2007, the Department of Physics takes care of the construction of a space telescope called MuSTAnG (Muon Spaceweather Telescope for Anisotropies at Greifswald), which will be part of a worldwide network of telescopes in Japan, Brazil, Australia and Germany.
The telescope will enable physicists and astrononomers at Greifswald University to forecast solar activity and has been co-funded by the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt.
In addition to MuSTAnG, the university owns an observatory, which is taken care of by a private initiative and open to the public.
Greifswald offers two multi-disciplinary approaches to environmental studies, called landscape ecology and environmental sciences bringing together different disciplines such as biology, geography, economics, law, and ethics.
The government-funded National Research Centre for Animal Disease on the Isle of Riems co-operates loosely with the university and is named Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut in honour of the university's former member of staff, Friedrich Loeffler.
Notable theologians have studied or worked here, for example Johannes Bugenhagen who was a close friend of Martin Luther.
In addition to the central libraries, many departments and institutes have their own libraries (German: Fachbibliothek).
The "winter term" (Wintersemester) lasts from October to March, and the "summer term" (Sommersemester) from April to September.
During the winter term, teaching usually takes place from mid-October to the end of January – the remainder being reserved for exams and the writing of term papers.
Cooperation[edit]Aside from teaching and research, one of major tasks of the university is cooperation with partners outside the actual university.
Research partners[edit] Alfried Krupp Institute of Advanced Study (left)Research emphasis lies in the field of plasma physics, landscape ecology, medicine, biotechnology, the Middle Ages and the languages and cultures of countries bordering the Baltic Sea.
The primary geographic focus of international collaboration is Northern Europe and Eastern Europe, which is due to the university's research focus in this area.
Partnerships with foreign universities to foster exchange of people (staff and students alike) and ideas is conducted in two different ways.
Firstly, through official partnership agreements with foreign universities, which involves the entire university and most or all of her disciplines.
Secondly, through contacts of professors, departments, and schools, which usually involves only one or few disciplines.
Student exchange from and to Greifswald is co-ordinated by the university's international office (Akademisches Auslandsamt).
The University of Greifswald has signed several official partnership agreements with other universities to foster international co-operation through faculty and student exchange and academic co-operation.
In Northern Europe, the university has signed partnership agreements with universities in Denmark (Århus, Holbæk), Finland (Helsinki), and Sweden (Lund).
In Eastern Europe, partnership agreements have been signed with universities in the Czech Republic (Brno), Estonia (Tartu), Latvia (Riga), Lithuania (Vilnius, Klaipeda), Poland (Poznan, Szczecin), and Russia (Kaliningrad, Saint Petersburg).
An exceptions are the University of Aberdeen as one of the ancient universities of Scotland, and the University of Padua in Italy.
In addition to official partnership agreements (see above) on the university level, there also numerous other channels of international contact on the level of chairs, departments or academic faculties, which often also include student exchange through the ERASMUS programme.
Co-operation of this kind takes place with numerous prestigious universities, including those in Barcelona, Bergen, Gothenburg, Graz, Copenhagen, Lancaster, Oslo, Prague, Reykjavík, Stockholm, Southampton, Uppsala or Utrecht.
Public events[edit]The university and its research partners regularly organise events for the general public, in the form of lecture series or public discussions.
There is an annual "children's university" week as well as a family university, in which current trends in research are presented in a more popular form.
Every semester, the student union organises a "24 hour lecture", in which many researchers of the university present interesting topics in short lectures starting at 6 pm on a Friday, and ending at 6 pm on the following Saturday.
It owned more than 140 square kilometres of arable land, the revenue of which was the basis for its financial independence and wealth.
Parts of the land that the university previously possessed have been given back to the university since the German reunification, but some claims are still pending in court.
Today, the university again manages some of the land previously owned, including a large forest near Eldena that is open to the public, but the revenue is low compared to other sources of funding.
The former financial independence of the university can still be seen in many historic buildings as well as a notable collection of art and other possessions.
The university owns various paintings and other artworks as well as a great number of historic books, some of which are lent for exhibition to independent public museums.
A number of other subjects such as the languages and cultures of Northern Europe and the Eastern Europe, philosophy, European history, physics, biochemistry, fine arts, church music have also continually achieved national and international attention.
Moreover, the University of Greifswald is frequently described as one of the most popular universities for undergraduate admission in Germany, which is due to a very good study environment as well as a co-operative spirit between faculty and students.
The small size of only 12,000 students (quantity) is comparable to other small universities such as St Andrews or Yale.
Rankings[edit]  Scientists at the Max-Planck-Institut für Plasmaphysik in Garching and Greifswald are researching fusion reactor technology and are constructing Wendelstein 7-X.
The University of Greifswald can look back at a long tradition of academic excellence and international collaboration, which reaches back to 1436, when the first teaching began.
Today, the university aspires to take back its old place among the world's universities, and has both strengthened its long traditions and welcomed new trends and innovations.

As of 2015, the renowned Times Higher Education World University Rankings lists the University of Greifswald among the best 350 universities in the world.
According to a 2008 study, Greifswald is Germany's 'youngest city', having the highest percentage of households by people under 30 years of age.
Two thirds of the enrolled students in 2009 came to Greifswald from outside the state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, and 5.
Student life[edit]Greifswald is situated in close proximity to the sea (near the islands Rügen and Usedom), about 200 km to the north of Germany's capital city, Berlin, and 100 km east of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern's largest city, Rostock.
The city of Greifswald has several museums, a theatre and a philharmonic orchestra as well as a breadth of sports clubs and societies.
According to a 2009 study, 44% of all people in Greifswald use their bicycle for daily transport, which is the highest such rate in Germany.
The path on the southern side of the river is good for walking, cycling, or jogging from the city centre to the seaside area, Wieck, and vice versa.

Greifswald is situated near the sea and the area between isles of Rügen and Usedom is among the most picturesque and best sailing and yachting regions in the whole of Germany.
There are two Sailing Clubs especially for students, the Studentischer Regattaverein, founded in 2007, which offers its Members a wide Range of Sailing Boats to take part in Regattas like Star, J/24, OK Dinghy, Europe, Vaurien, H Dinghy and a Nacra 5.
The other one, being the oldest Sailing Club in Greifswald, is the Akademischer Seglerverein (Academic Sailing Club).
There is a golf club called Hanseatischer Golfclub which is popular with university staff and students alike.
The student-run, not-for-profit clubs Mensaclub, Geographenkeller, Geologenkeller, Club 9 and Kiste are very popular and provide an inexpensive way of going out and meeting other students.
Apart from the localities that are run by students, there is an abundance of different pubs, clubs and restaurants.

People who enjoy being outdoors make use of the fact that three of Germany's 14 national parks – Jasmund, Müritz and Vorpommersche Boddenlandschaft – can be reached within one hour or less from Greifswald.
Housing[edit]As is customary at German universities, students are generally required to arrange for their own housing.
There are a few low-rate student dorms in the town, however a large majority of students share private flats with a couple of other students (German: Wohngemeinschaft, abbreviated WG), or live in single apartments.
In recent years, it has become increasingly difficult for newly matriculated students to find appropriate flats in Greifswald, which is due to a growing number of students and a stagnating market.
As landlords often prefer their prospective tenants to be fluent in German, this may cause disadvantages for international students wishing to rent their own place.

1900Greifswald has a number of different student fraternities and sororities, which are called Studentenverbindungen (the singular is Studentenverbindung).
Studentenverbindungen have a long tradition as most of them were founded in the 19th century, and they are to some extent comparable to the fraternities in the United States.
As traditional symbols (couleur) corporation members wear coloured caps and ribbons at ceremonial occasions (Kommers) and some still practice the traditional academic fencing, a kind of duel, in order to "shape their members for the challenges of life".
The political views of the fraternities are more or less conservative, but two of them (Rugia and Markomannia) have been linked to the far-right NPD.
Johannes Bugenhagen (1485–1558) – Religious reformer in North Germany, Denmark and Norway; friend of Martin Luther.
The University of Greifswald is associated with a number of notable people, including both former students and faculty.
For instance, two Nobel prize laureates as well as two German chancellors have studied or worked in Greifswald.
Johannes Stark (1874–1957) received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1919 (see Nobel Prize Website) "for his discovery of the Doppler effect in canal rays and the splitting of spectral lines in electric fields" during his time at the University of Greifswald.
In 1939, Gerhard Domagk (1895–1964) received the Nobel Prize in Medicine (see Nobel Prize Website) "for the discovery of the antibacterial effects of prontosil".
The university was named in honour of its former student and faculty member, the writer, politician and poet Ernst Moritz Arndt.

de The University of Göttingen (German: Georg-August-Universität Göttingen, GAU), known informally as Georgia Augusta, is a public comprehensive research university in the town of Göttingen, Germany.
Founded in 1734 by George II, King of Great Britain and Elector of Hanover, and starting classes in 1737, the university is the oldest in the state of Lower Saxony and the largest in student enrollment, which stands at around 26,000.
Göttingen is one of the most prestigious universities in Germany, previously supported by the German Universities Excellence Initiative.
With membership in Coimbra Group and around 45 Nobel Prize winners, the university enjoys great international renown.
The university maintains strong connections with major research institutes based in Göttingen as well, especially those of the Max Planck Society for the Advancement of Science and the Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Scientific Community.
Initially, the only new buildings constructed for the opening of the university were a riding hall and a fencing house, while courses were taught in the Paulinerkirche and associated Dominican monastery, or in the homes of professors.
18th–19th centuries[edit]Throughout the remainder of the 18th century the University of Göttingen was in the top rank of German universities, with its free spirit and atmosphere of scientific exploration and research.
Famous till our days is Georg Christoph Lichtenberg, the first to hold a professorship (1769–99) explicitly dedicated to experimental physics in Germany.
By 1812, Göttingen had become an internationally acknowledged modern university with a library of more than 250,000 volumes.
In the 18th century Johann Stephan Pütter, the most prestigious scholar of public law at that time, taught jus publicum here for half a century.
The subject had attracted students such as Klemens Wenzel Lothar von Metternich, later diplomat and Prime Minister of Austria, and Wilhelm von Humboldt, who later established the University of Berlin.
In 1809 Arthur Schopenhauer, the German philosopher best known for his work The World as Will and Representation, became a student at the university, where he studied metaphysics and psychology under Gottlob Ernst Schulze, who advised him to concentrate on Plato and Kant.
King George II in the Pauliner Church in 1748By the university's centenary in 1837, it was known as the "university of law", as the students enrolled by the faculty of law often made up more than half of the university's students.
However, political disturbances, in which both professors and students were implicated, lowered the attendance to 860 in 1834.
Otto von Bismarck, the main creator and the first Chancellor of the second German Empire, had also studied law in Göttingen in 1833: he lived in a tiny house on the "Wall", now known as "Bismarck Cottage".
According to oral tradition, he lived there because his rowdiness had caused him to be banned from living within the city walls.
Bernhard Riemann, Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet and a number of significant mathematicians made their contributions to mathematics here.
By 1900, David Hilbert and Felix Klein had attracted mathematicians from around the world to Göttingen, which made Göttingen a world mecca of mathematics at the beginning of the 20th century.
End of the 19th century – beginning of the 20th century[edit]During this period, the University of Göttingen achieved its academic peak.
The old Auditorium Maximum (built in 1826–1865)In 1903, its teaching staff numbered 121 and its students 1529.
Ludwig Prandtl joined the university in 1904, and developed it into a leader in fluid mechanics and in aerodynamics over the next two decades.
He introduced the concept of boundary layer and founded mathematical aerodynamics by calculating air flow in the down wind direction.
From 1921 to 1933, the physics theory group was led by Max Born, who, during this time, became one of the three discoverers of the non-relativistic theory of quantum mechanics.
Most of these prizes were given in the first half of the 20th century, which was called the "Göttingen Nobel prize wonder".
Alte Aula (Great Hall), also Karzer, at Wilhelmsplatz (built in 1835–1837)The German inventor of the jet engine, Pabst von Ohain, also studied aerodynamics in Goettingen under Ludwig Prandtl.
Thus, many American students were proud of having studied in Germany, and the University of Göttingen had profound impacts on the US.
A number of American politicians, lawyers, historians and writers received their education from both Harvard and Göttingen.
For example, Edward Everett, once Secretary of State and President of Harvard University, stayed in Göttingen for two years of study.
John Lothrop Motley, a diplomat and historian, even had personal friendship with Otto von Bismark during his two-year-long study in Göttingen.
"Great purge" of 1933[edit]In the 1930s, the university became a focal point for the Nazi crackdown on "Jewish physics", as represented by the work of Albert Einstein.
In what was later called the "great purge" of 1933, academics including Max Born, Victor Goldschmidt, James Franck, Eugene Wigner, Leó Szilárd, Edward Teller, Emmy Noether, and Richard Courant were expelled or fled.

Gerhard Schröder, the former Chancellor of Germany, also graduated from the school of law here in Göttingen, and he became a lawyer thereafter.
More than 400 professors and 4,000 academic staff work at the university, assisted by a technical and administrative staff of over 7,000.
The post-war expansion of the university led to the establishment of a new, modern 'university quarter' in the north of the town.
The architecture of the old university can still be seen in the Auditorium Maximum (1826/1865) and the Great Hall (1835/1837) at Wilhelmsplatz.
Faculties, centers, and institutes[edit]The university itself encompasses 13 faculties and a total of 47 additional centers and institutes (including associated centers and institutes but excluding institutes that operate within the faculties themselves).
" In the 2012 Excellence Initiative, Göttingen succeeded in obtaining funds for its graduate school "Neurosciences and Molecular Biosciences" and its research cluster "Microscopy at the Nanometer Range" but failed in its bid for future concept financing.
The most recent Nobel laureates associated with the university are Stefan Hell (Nobel Prize in Chemistry, 2014) and Thomas C.
Associated institutions[edit]The university is organizationally and personally interlinked with the following independent and semi-independent institutions.
Library[edit]Closely linked with the university is the Göttingen State and University Library (German: Niedersächsische Staats- und Universitätsbibliothek Göttingen, or SUB Göttingen; English short form: Goettingen SUB).
5 million volumes and precious manuscripts, the library is designed for Göttingen University as well as the central library for the German State of Lower Saxony (with its central catalogue) and for the Göttingen Academy of Sciences, originally founded as the 'Royal Society for Sciences'.
Exchange programs[edit]As Germany is a member of the European Union, university students have the opportunity to participate in the Erasmus Programme.

Göttingen is like Cambridge in England or Yale in America: very provincial, not on the way to anywhere – no one comes to these backwaters except for the company of professors.
There is an inscription in the Ratskeller there which reads 'Extra Gottingam non est vita', 'Outside Göttingen there is no life'.
This epigram, or should I call it epitaph, is not taken as seriously by the undergraduates as by the professors.
Located to the south of the city is the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science with its main building, the "Mathematisches Institut", on the same street as the German Aerospace Center and the Max Planck Institute for Dynamics and Self-Organisation.
Elsewhere in the city are the departments of Anthropology and Educational Sciences as well as the Medical Faculty with its associated hospitals.
Just north of the city a new scientific center has been built in which most of the natural sciences (Chemistry, Biology, Plant Pathology, Agronomy, Forestry, Geology, Physics, Computer Science) are now located, including the GZMB.

The convent was dissolved in 1773, so that its funds could be used to found the University of Münster on 16 April 1780.
In 1631, Pope Urban VII and Emperor Ferdinand II issued privileges, allowing the establishment of a university in Münster.
However, due to a lack of funding, they were only put to use in 1780, when the modern University of Münster was founded with four faculties: Law, Medicine, Philosophy and Theology.
In 1843, it was renamed to Royal Theological and Philosophical Academy (Königliche Theologische und Philosophische Akademie), informally Münster Academy (Akademie Münster).
European degrees[edit]1999 saw the beginning of the Bologna Process, which aimed to ensure comparability in the standards and quality of higher education qualifications.

The Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz (German: Johannes Gutenberg-Universität Mainz) is a university in Mainz, Rhineland Palatinate, Germany, named after the printer Johannes Gutenberg.
With approximately 36,500 students (2014) in about 150 schools and clinics, it is among the ten largest universities in Germany.
The university is considered one of the most prestigious universities in Germany, especially in the natural sciences and economics.
At the time, establishing a university required papal approval and Adolf II initiated the approval process during his time in office.
In the confusion after the establishment of the Mainz Republic of 1792 and its subsequent recapture by the Prussians, academic activity came to a gradual standstill.
In 1798 the university became active again under French governance, and lectures in the department of medicine took place until 1823.
Only the faculty of theology continued teaching during the 19th century, albeit as a theological Seminary (since 1877 "College of Philosophy and Theology").
In a decree on 1 March the French military government implied that the University of Mainz would continue to exist: the University shall be "enabled to resume its function".
The remains of anti-aircraft warfare barracks erected in 1938 after the remilitarization of the Rhineland during the Third Reich served as the university's first buildings and are still in use today.
The continuation of academic activity between the old university and Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz, in spite of an interruption spanning over 100 years, is contested.
The departments (Fakultaeten) were dismantled and the University was organized into broad fields of study (Fachbereiche).
Finally in 1974 Peter Schneider was elected as the first president of what was now a "constituted group-university" institute of higher education.
In 1990 Jürgen Zöllner became University President yet spent only a year in the position after he was appointed Minister for "Science and Advanced Education" for the State of Rhineland-Palatinate.
As the coordinator for the SPD's higher education policy, this furloughed professor from the Institute for Physiological Chemistry played a decisive role in the SPD's higher education policy and in the development of Study Accounts.
Today[edit]Today the Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz has approximately 36,000 students (as of 2010) and consists of over 150 institutions and clinics.
The range of studies is comprehensive; the university lacks some technical studies, veterinary medicine and nutrition science.
The University of Mainz does not currently levy fees or tuition (Studiengebühren) for a regular course of study.
The Ministry for Science and Advanced Education introduced "study accounts" (Studienkonten) that were developed jointly with Prof.
During the transition period, overdrafts on the account would incur a flat-rate charge of 650 Euro for every overdrawn semester.
It is still contested as to whether the enormous administrative burden will lead to an actual improvement of academic conditions.
**Measurable success is similar by the introduction of long-term tuition in other federal states and its effect on the decline of nominally enrolled students.
Departments[edit]The Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz is divided in ten departments since 1 September 2010.
BiologyThen there are the Academy of Music and the Art School, which are as independent art colleges of the Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz.
Nearly all its institutions and facilities are located on the site of a former barracks in the south west part of the city.
The university medical centre is located off campus, as is the Department of Applied Linguistics and Cultural Sciences, which was integrated with the university in 1949 and is located in Germersheim.
On campus next to the University is the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry, the Max Planck Institute for Polymer Research, the Institute of Molecular Biology, the electron accelerator MAMI, the research reactor TRIGA, the botanical garden, a sports stadium and an indoor swimming pool.

﻿University of WürzburgJulius-Maximilians-Universität Würzburg University of Würzburg seal.
de University of Würzburg logo The Julius Maximilian University of Würzburg (also referred to as the University of Würzburg, in German Julius-Maximilians-Universität Würzburg) is a public research university in Würzburg, Germany.
The University of Wurzburg is one of the oldest institutions of higher learning in Germany, having been founded in 1402.
This name is taken from Julius Echter von Mespelbrunn, Prince-Bishop of Würzburg, who reestablished the university in 1582, and Prince Elector Maximilian Joseph, the prince under whom secularization occurred at the start of the 19th century.
The University’s central administration, foreign student office, and several research institutes are located within the area of the old town, while the new liberal arts campus, with its modern library, overlooks the city from the east.
The university today enrolls approximately 29,000 students, out of which more than 1,000 come from other countries.
History[edit]Establishment in 1402[edit]  Old University, drawing from the 17th or 18th centuryAlthough the university was first founded in 1402, it was short-lived.
Jacob, held the then dissolute student lifestyle responsible for the premature decline of the city's first university.
In the Annales Hirsaugiensis Chronologia Mystica of 1506 he cites bathing, love, brawling, gambling, inebriation, squabbling, and general pandemonium as "greatly impeding the academic achievement in Würzburg".
Evidence of this is provided by the fatal stabbing of the university's first chancellor, Johann Zantfurt, in 1413, by a scholar's unruly assistant, or famulus, evidently the result of these very influences.
Despite Egloffstein's thwarted first attempt at founding a university, the city still boasts one of the oldest universities in the German-speaking world, almost on a par with Prague (1348), Vienna (1365), Heidelberg (1386), Cologne (1388), and Erfurt (1392).
A "second founding" by Prince Bishop Julius Echter von Mespelbrunn (1545–1617) in 1582 offered the institution guaranteed autonomous self-government.
The university was fiercely Roman Catholic and initially considered a "bastion of Catholicism in the face of Protestantism", words also used in the university charter which prevented all non-Catholics from graduating from or receiving tenure at the Alma Julia.
Over a century would pass before the university opened its doors to non-Catholics, in keeping with the spirit of Enlightenment encouraged by Prince Bishop Friedrich Karl von Schönborn's newly formulated students' charter of 1734.
The resultant increase in religious tolerance even enabled the summoning and subsequent appointment of the famous physician, Karl Kaspar von Siebold, under Schönborn's successor, Adam Friedrich von Seinsheim.
Shortly after his arrival in 1769, Protestant medical students were permitted to study for their doctorates at the university.
Würzburg's increasing secularisation as a bishopric and its eventual surrender to Bavarian rule at the beginning of the 19th century resulted in the loss of the university's Roman Catholic character.
The end of the city's status as a Grand Duchy under Ferdinand of Toscana in 1814 heralded the Alma Julia's ideological transition to the non-denominational establishment which endures to this day.
This new inclusiveness towards professors and students alike was instrumental in the resultant upturn in all areas of research and education in the 19th century.
Since then, the university has borne the name of its second and most influential founder, officially known as the Julius-Maximilians-Universität of Bavaria.
Their progress culminated in the discovery of x-rays by physicist Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen, first winner of the Nobel Prize for Physics, in 1895.
Röntgen's discovery, which he dubbed a "new kind of ray", is regarded as the university's greatest intellectual achievement, and, simultaneously, a scientific development of huge global import.
Röntgen's successors, namely Wilhelm Wien, Johannes Stark and the chemists Emil Fischer and Eduard Buchner, also number among the succession of Nobel Prize winners to lecture at the university, a tradition which endures in the modern-day example of Klaus von Klitzing.
1945 to today[edit]After World War II, the free state of Bavaria invested a fortune in the rebuilding and renovation of the university buildings, which had been severely damaged by Allied bombing.
The eventual rebuilding of the Neubaukirche ("Neubau Church"), also affiliated to the legal faculty and almost razed to the ground in 1945, marked the end of the city's extensive reconstruction process.
In 1970 it was decided that the church, one of the most important examples of 16th century vaulted architecture in southern Germany, should fulfill a dual function as a place of worship and as the university banquet, assembly, and concert hall.
Echter's heart, removed for safekeeping during the war, has once again found its place in the church he designed, fulfilling a request made during his lifetime.

In 1776 the Weimar Princely Free Zeichenschule was established, but gradually lost significance after the Grand Ducal Saxon Art School was founded in 1860.
In 1829 the architect Clemens Wenzeslaus Coudray established the Free School of Trades (which later became the Grand Ducal Saxon Architectural Trade School, or State School of Architecture), which operated in the evenings and Sundays and supplemented the courses at the Free Zeichenschule.
Students were instructed in a variety of artistic subjects, including landscape, historical, portrait and animal painting, and sculpting.
In 1905 the Art School merged with the Weimar Sculpture School, which, although integrated into the educational system in a “cooperative relationship between high and applied art”, was independently managed.
The development of the Bauhaus-Universität Weimar was also strongly influenced by the Grand Ducal Saxon School of Arts and Crafts which trained artisans in the handicrafts between 1907 and 1915.
The names of renowned artists, instructors and students can be found in the historical documents and records of both schools.
It was the making of a new type of art school, a pioneer of modernity, the legacy of which continues to influence the Bauhaus-University Weimar today.
” His “concept of collaboration with the industry” was strongly opposed, not least of all because he was “determined from the very start to beat down any resistance toward this new kind of architecturally related art.
”The increasing equalization of professors and workshop instructors and unbridgeable differences made it impossible “for art to develop freely, without purpose and with no connection to architecture at the Bauhaus.
” As a result, the State College of Fine Arts was founded in 1921, an institution at which academically traditional masters could work and teach, such as Richard Engelmann, Max Thedy, Walther Klemm, Alexander Olbricht and Hugo Gugg (Hedwig Holtz-Sommer’s instructor).
The Bauhaus only remained in Weimar until spring 1925 when it was forced to relocate to Dessau for political reasons.
Although the College of Architecture continued to adhere to the idea of the Bauhaus, it offered a much more practical orientation.
This corresponded to the “concept of a construction-based, productive working community,” which represented one of the founding principles of this successor institution.
After completing their education, graduates received a diploma in the Construction department and the title “Journeyman” or “Master” in their area of handicraft.
In his opinion, it was necessary to preserve the German styles typical of the region, so that people could find identification and orientation in times of rapid social and cultural upheaval.
Graduates of the Architecture course received the title “Diplom-Architekt” (certified architect), while artists received a simple certificate and craftspeople received the title “Journeyman” or “Master”.
Director[edit]•1930–1939 Paul Schultze-Naumburg, architect and art theoristCollege of Architecture and Fine Arts[edit]The institution officially attained college-level status in 1942.
By this time, the School of Trades had been removed from the college, which now called itself the College of Architecture and Fine Arts.
After World War II, the Soviet Military Administration of Thuringia oversaw the restructuring of the college to reflect antifascist-democratic principles.
Under the aegis of the architect Hermann Henselmann, appointed director in 1946, the college focused its efforts to rebuild the country and pick up where the Bauhaus left off.
Some even suggested changing the name of the college to “The Bauhaus – College of Architecture and Handicraft and Engineering Design.

The “Fine Arts” department, which had previously been chaired by the sculptor Siegfried Tschierschky, was dissolved.
The new College of Architecture was placed under the control of the “Ministry of Reconstruction” with the objective to develop academic and research programs for a new technical college of civil engineering.
In 1954 the college received a rectorial constitution with two new faculties: “Civil Engineering” and “Building Materials Science and Technology”.
Otto Englberger, an architect, professor of “Residential and Community Building,” and provisional director of the college since 1951, was appointed the first vice-chancellor of the new College of Architecture and Civil Engineering Weimar (HAB).
In the following decades, the college became one of the leading academic institutions in the field of civil engineering, respected throughout East and West Germany alike.
Because the college was so integrated in the political system of the GDR, the direction of its instruction and research activities was largely dictated by the government for the purpose of carrying out the latest civil engineering tasks.
The third higher education reform of 1968/69 modernized and reorganized the structure of the college based on business administration principles.
The faculties were replaced by “sections”, and the college was expanded to include the section of “Computer Technology and Data Processing.
Thanks to these research efforts, the college established relations with other institutions, including several in West Germany.
Ever since 1951, students in all disciplines were required by East German law to pass a basic study program in Marxist-Leninist philosophy.

The goal was to quickly adapt the college to the basic principles of freedom and democracy and integrate it into the international community of higher education institutions.
A new chapter began in 1993 with the establishment of the “Faculty of Art and Design” which reincorporated the artistic disciplines into the academic profile of the college.
The establishment of the “Faculty of Media” in 1996 emphasized the college’s dedication to progressive thinking.
After changing its name to the "Bauhaus-Universität Weimar" in 1996, the university demonstrated its dedication to the spirit of the Bauhaus.
The well-known artists and instructors of this period include: Lucius Burckhardt, Werner Holzwarth and Wolfgang Ernst.
The Bauhaus sites in Weimar include the main building (formerly the Grand Ducal Saxon Art School) and the Van de Velde building (formerly the Grand Ducal Saxon School of Arts and Crafts) at the Bauhaus-Universität.
It has fostered a diverse profile of instruction and research based on engineering and architectural disciplines.
The term “Bauhaus” in its name stands for eagerness to experiment, openness, creativity, proximity to industrial practice and internationality.
Students also learn about the function, significance and planning of special buildings and facilities (such as hospitals).
)Civil Engineering[edit]  The Faculty of Civil Engineering, located on CoudraystraßeThe faculty has been expanding and developing in the field of civil engineering for almost six decades.
The academic programs focus mainly on recognizing and promoting creative and intellectual strengths and searching for ways to put them to practical use.
The Faculty of Art and Design has been using the studios and classrooms in the former School of Arts and Crafts (Van de Velde Building) since 1996.
Following a renovation phase lasting two years, the Faculty of Art and Design returned to the Van de Velde Building in April 2010.
By founding the faculty in 1996, the Bauhaus-Universität Weimar responded to the ever-growing significance of media for the sciences, society and the economy.
The faculty meets the contemporary challenges of media-aesthetic, media-cultural and media-technological natures with an interdisciplinary approach in the best Bauhaus tradition—by interweaving art and technology.
The faculty fosters the growth of creative media artists with strong science backgrounds in self-designed project-based courses.
Its graduates are active in the media-, culture, multi-media- and telecommunication industries, as well as in research and instruction.
Following an urban planning competition in 1991, the architects’ office meck architekten (Munich) were commissioned to design the building.
After a four-year construction phase costing 12 million euros, the new university library and an integrated main auditorium were officially opened in 2005, and in 2006, the building was awarded the Thuringian State Prize for Architecture and Urban Planning.
With over 5,000 m2 of usable floor space, the library houses a collection of approximately 488,500 books and other media (as of 2013).

de The University of Kiel (German: Christian-Albrechts-Universität zu Kiel, CAU) is a university in the city of Kiel, Germany.
It was founded in 1665 as the Academia Holsatorum Chiloniensis by Christian Albert, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp and has approximately 24,000 students today.
Until 1864/66 it was not only the northernmost university in Germany but at the same time the 2nd largest university of Denmark.

But those in the city who envisioned economic advantages of a university in the city won, and Kiel thus became the northernmost university in the German Holy Roman Empire.
After 1773, when Kiel had come under Danish rule, the university began to thrive, and when Kiel became part of Prussia in the year 1867, the university grew rapidly in size.
The university opened one of the first botanical gardens in Germany (now the Alter Botanischer Garten Kiel), and Martin Gropius designed many of the new buildings needed to teach the growing number of students.
The Christiana Albertina was one of the first German universities to obey the Gleichschaltung in 1933 and agreed to remove many professors and students from the school, for instance Ferdinand Tönnies or Felix Jacoby.
During World War II, the University of Kiel suffered heavy damage, therefore it was later rebuilt at a different location with only a few of the older buildings housing the medical school.
There are several Nobel Prize Winners affiliated with the University of Kiel, including:•1902 Theodor Mommsen (Literature)•1905 Philipp Lenard (Physics)•1918 Max Planck (Physics)•1922 Otto Meyerhof (Medicine)•1950 Kurt Alder and Otto Diels (Chemistry).

The foundation stone was laid already in 1498 at the site of a demolished synagogue; a foundation charter was issued by Pope Alexander VI in the same year.
Within the first year, more than 900 students from all over Germany, Poland, Sweden, Norway, and Denmark enrolled.
The Viadrina enjoyed an excellent reputation in Brandenburg and the surrounding regions, and its graduates had high positions in administration, politics, law and the church.
One of its earliest chancellors, Bishop Georg von Blumenthal (1490–1550) was a vigorous opponent of the Protestant Reformation and did his utmost to expel Lutherans such as Jodocus Willich.
Nevertheless, the University, like its Prussian counterpart, the University of Königsberg established in 1544, turned to Lutheran orthodoxy.
After the ruling House of Hohenzollern had converted to Calvinism, the 'Great Elector' Frederick William and his governor Prince John Maurice of Nassau-Siegen in 1655 founded the University of Duisburg, a Reformed college in the Duchy of Cleves.
Old Collegienhaus (1911)Frederick William also opened the Frankfurt University for Jewish students, against fierce resistance by the teaching staff.
While damages of the Thirty Years' War still had to be repaired, he had a botanical garden laid out next to the university premises.
In 1736 the eminent jurist Johann Jakob Moser was called to head the Faculty of Law at the university, but had to leave after three years due to his thoroughly Liberal ideas which were disliked by the Prussian king Frederick William I.
In the course of the Prussian Reforms during the Napoleonic Wars, the University of Frankfurt was moved to Breslau (present-day Wrocław, Poland) in 1811.
It merged with the University of Breslau, the Leopoldina established in 1702 by the Habsburg emperor Leopold I, in order to be competitive with the newly founded University of Berlin.
The merger included the transfer of the comprehensive library stocks, then with more than 28,000 volumes the second largest in Prussia after the Königsberg State and University Library collection, up the Oder river by boat.
It was hardly damaged in World War II and first used as a home for refugees from the former eastern territories.
Famous students at the historical Viadrina included the philosopher Ulrich von Hutten (1488–1523) and the theologian and political leader Thomas Müntzer (c.
1489–1525), the musician Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach (1714–1788), the physicians Marcus Elieser Bloch (1723–1799) and Johann Gottlieb Walter (1734–1818), Wilhelm (1767–1836) and Alexander von Humboldt (1769–1859), as well as the poet Heinrich von Kleist (1777–1811).
A prime focus of the educational program is to attract students from throughout Europe in order to create a multinational student body.
Currently about 40 percent of the students are foreigners (mostly Polish), a greater proportion than at other German universities.
The two universities jointly operate the Collegium Polonicum, located just opposite Viadrina on the Polish side of the Oder River.
Notable among the research institutions at Viadrina University is the Frankfurt Institute of Transformational Studies (FIT).
The university's former president, Professor Gesine Schwan, ran for President of Germany both in 2004 and 2009, being narrowly defeated by Horst Köhler twice.

Its foundation and history has been marked by often controversial debates and significant difficulties to establish the new university in the German educational system.
In 1995 Times Higher Education noted that the university was considered by some "an idealistic model for the future of German higher education and [by] others .
In 2015 2107 students are enrolled at the University of Witten/Herdecke and it has a staff of 524 people, including faculty of 59 professors and 207 lecturers/researchers.
There are also more Master students than Bachelor students, showing the university's strength in graduate education.
Furthermore, the university encourages its students to take on social responsibility and considers civic engagement as the “third mission” in addition to research and student education.
In the CHE 2012 report the university's programmes in Economics, Dental Medicine and Human Medicine have received top rankings in student's and graduates satisfaction.
(December 2012) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) 1982: Recognition by the Federal Government as Germany's first private university.
Early supporter of the university include Alfred Herrhausen, Gerd Bucerius, Reinhard Mohn and the Bertelsmann Foundation.
1984: The degree programmes in economics and dental medicine are established1990: The German Council of Science and Humanities reviews the university and grants it public funding support for buildings.
It will be become a core element of the Witten/Herdecke identity as every student regardless of his subject has to take courses offered by the faculty, thereby gaining interdisciplinary skills and reflexive capacities.
1995: Students of the University found the StudierendenGesellschaft Witten/Herdecke, a student association which introduces and until today operates an innovative inverted generational-contract payment model for student fees.
The model avoids social selection in the admission process by enabeling students to repaying their tuition according to their own financial capacities after they have embarked on their professional careers.
1996: The status of Witten/Herdecke University as a model university is underlined by a second review through the German Council of Science and Humanities.
The state government follows recommendations to subsidize Witten/Herdecke University with public funds and the university establishes a degree programme in Nursing Science, the first of its kind in Germany.
2005: The University converts all of its diploma programmes to bachelor/master programmes, accredited by the summer term of 2005.
2006: The University is urged to undergo a notable expansion of research and teaching at the Faculty of Medicine.
In July 2006 the German Council of Science and Humanities approves the revised concept of the medical curriculum.

eu Logo of the Universität of Erlangen-Nürnberg Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-Nürnberg (German: Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg, FAU) is a public research university in the cities of Erlangen and Nuremberg in Bavaria, Germany.
The name Friedrich-Alexander comes from the university's first founder Friedrich, Margrave of Brandenburg-Bayreuth, and its benefactor Christian Frederick Charles Alexander, Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach.
It has 5 faculties, 23 departments/schools, 30 clinical departments, 19 autonomous departments, 656 professors, 3,404 members of academic staff and roughly 13,000 employees.
In winter semester 2014/15 around 39,085 students (including 3,556 foreign students) enrolled in the university in 239 fields of study, with about 2/3 studying at the Erlangen campus and the remaining 1/3 at the Nuremberg campus.
In 2013, 5251 students graduated from the university and 663 doctorates and 50 post-doctoral theses were registered.
Moreover, FAU received 171 million Euro (2013) external funding in the same year, making it one of the strongest third-party funded universities in Germany.
In 2006 and 2007, as part of the national excellence initiative, FAU was chosen by the German Research Foundation as one of the winners in the German Universities Excellence Initiative.
FAU is also a member of DFG (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft) and the Top Industrial Managers for Europe network.
In Academic Ranking of World Universities for year 2014, FAU ranked second among German universities in Engineering/Technology and Computer Sciences group for all four ranking parameters TOP, FUN, HiCi and PUB.
Christian Frederick Charles Alexander, Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach (one of the two namesakes of the institution) provided significant support to the early university.
During the Nazi era, the university was one of the first that had a majority of Nazi supporters in the student council.
In 1961, the business college in Nuremberg was merged with the university in Erlangen, so that now the combined institution has a physical presence in the two cities.
•1743: Friedrich, Margrave of Brandenburg-Bayreuth, issues an edict whereby the university recently founded in Bayreuth is transferred to Erlangen.
•1769: The University at Erlangen is given the new name of Friedrich-Alexander-Universität in honour of Alexander, Margrave of Ansbach and Bayreuth.
•1961: The FAU acquires a further faculty through merger with the Nuremberg College of Economics and Social Sciences (founded in 1919).
(FAU is thus the first of the traditional universities of the old federal republic to incorporate engineering as an independent faculty.
•2004: Inauguration of the new building at the WiSo Faculty of Business Administration, Economics & Social Sciences in Nuremberg.
Faculties[edit]  The Kollegienhaus, the historical central building and lecture hall of the University at the borders of the SchlossgartenIn February 2007, the senate of the university decided upon a restructuring into five faculties.
Then, the University of Erlangen thus won out against the city of Nuremberg, which, for decades, had been demanding the establishment of a college of engineering in Nuremberg.
Since the expansive areas of building land required for this project were not available in the center of Erlangen, the foundations for a new university campus were laid in the south east of the town in 1964.
The formal establishment of the Faculty of Engineering, then the seventh faculty at the University, took place in 1966.
What was unique at the time was that the various engineering departments were subsumed, as a faculty, into the main university rather than constituting an independent university.
)•Mechanical Engineering•Computer ScienceThe Faculty has close connections both with other natural sciences and with traditional subjects at the university.
The prioritizing of teaching and research is realized through the principle of teaching based on research, and the faculty plays a significant role in social and technological developments.
Faculty promotes knowledge transfer, mobility and exchange within research and teaching in cooperation with numerous universities worldwide.
Partnerships with businesses, research institutions, as well as international educational and cultural institutes are well established.
As part of this initiative, FAU was awarded the contract for the Erlangen Graduate School in Advanced Optical Technologies (SAOT), which received 1.
The Cluster of Excellence 'Engineering of Advanced Materials and Processes' (EAM) was also established at FAU as part of the initiative and has been approved in the second round.
The main research focus is on the fundamental and applied aspects of designing and creating novel high-performance materials.
Erlangen Graduate School in Advanced Optical Technologies[edit]See for more information: Advanced Optical Technologies, FAUThe Erlangen Graduate School in Advanced Optical Technologies (SAOT) was founded in 2006.
SAOT’s scientific focus lies on optics and optical technology, two fields which are considered key technologies of the 21st century.
SAOT offers an excellent interdisciplinary research environment, which is firmly grounded in a vast network of cooperations with internationally leading experts.
At the Graduate School, young scientists work at the interface of a variety of disciplines such as materials science, metrology, medicine and processing technology.
With their research, these young scientists make a considerable contribution to optical technologies being used to their full potential.
The University provides six professorship positions to the research center and guarantees the scientific integration into the academic environment.
AudioLabs will benefit from Fraunhofer IIS’ extensive history and expertise in the field of audio and multimedia technologies.
This close cooperation of both partners allows for a unique organization with competencies ranging from basic research and teaching to technology implementation in innovative multimedia systems.
It is having a team of globally renowned scientists, those are working to shape the future of audio and multimedia technologies in the research areas such as audio coding, audio signal analysis and perceptual spatial audio signal processing.
Being in the vicinity of the Erlangen University and the Audio & Multimedia division of Fraunhofer IIS, this location enables close scientific collaboration in an ideal way.
In addition, it allows for use of the modern infrastructure of Fraunhofer IIS including acoustics labs, recording studios or digital cinema labs.
Emerging Fields Initiative [edit]See for more information: Emerging Fields Initiative, FAUBeing one of the strongest and most reputable research university in Germany, FAU boasting numerous outstanding academic approaches and perspectives.

In November 2009, its campus project received approval from the Korean Ministry of Education, Science and Technology.
The FAU Busan Branch Campus offers a Graduate School with a master's degree program in Chemical and Bioengineering and a research center.
In 2014, the university announced its intention of working toward making the Busan-Jinhae Free Economic Zone an educational hub.
Awards[edit]Alexander von Humboldt Professorships[edit]In 2010, the newly announced professor of physics and co-director of the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Light, Prof.
Vahid Sandoghdar was awarded an Alexander von Humboldt Professorship, Germany’s highest-endowed international research award, endowed with €3.
German Excellence Initiative[edit]The University of Erlangen-Nürnberg was successful within the German Universities Excellence Initiative in competing for a "cluster of excellence" and a graduate school.
The Cluster of Excellence 'Engineering of Advanced Materials' (EAM)" focuses on interdisciplinary developing new materials, joining engineering and natural sciences.
The Erlangen Graduate School in Advanced Optical Technologies emphasizes a strong focus in optical and photonics technology in the natural sciences, in engineering and the medical sciences and aims for a concise doctoral education.
After an in-depth evaluation, both programs were extended for the third phase of the German Excellence Initiative in 2012 until 2017.
They contribute significantly to the research funding of the University, including five new research buildings, permanent new technical facilities and research and teaching staff.

de   The main building of the Ulm UniversityUlm University (German: Universität Ulm) is a public university in the city of Ulm, in the South German state of Baden-Württemberg.
The university was founded in 1967 and focuses on natural sciences, medicine, engineering sciences, mathematics, economics and computer science.
Times Higher Education (THE) ranks it at position 16 among the world's top 100 universities under the age of 50 years in 2014, making it the highest-ranked young university in Germany.
In 2007, University of Ulm was appreciated by German Universities Excellence Initiative and altogether financially endowed for International Graduate School in Molecular Medicine.
In 2012, University of Ulm has been selected for 27th position by Academic Ranking of World Universities according to ratio of Academic staff to students indicator.
The campus of the university is located north of the city on a hill called Oberer Eselsberg, while the university hospital has additional sites across the city.

In the decades following the foundation, the spectrum of subjects has steadily been extended, and the university has grown significantly.
An important step in combining the strength of industrial and academic research was the realization of the idea of a science park around the main university campus.
Research centers of companies like Daimler, BMW, Siemens and in the past also Nokia, AEG, have been established at the site, in addition to institutes of the university focusing on applied research.
Among other large research projects, the university features four Collaborative Research Centers (German: Sonderforschungsbereiche), which are established on a competitive basis by the German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG).
In 2003, the Ulm University was involved in founding a private university in Egypt, the German University in Cairo.
Since 2007, the university has been participating in the German Universities Excellence Initiative with the newly founded International Graduate School in Molecular Medicine Ulm.
Structure[edit]The university is composed of four divisions, which in German universities traditionally are called faculties, and separate institutes.
The four faculties are the medical faculty, the engineering and computer science faculty, the natural science faculty and the mathematics and economics faculty.
The Science Park[edit]The University of Ulm's campus is located on a hill on the outskirts of the city of Ulm hosts a variety of public and industrial research and development centres, as well as three major hospitals - jointly referred to as the science park.
This close proximity of academic and industrial R&D is designed to improve interaction between industrial needs on the one hand and academic teaching and research on the other.
Students of the Sciences often spend their internship in companies located close to the campus or work on their master's thesis projects in close cooperation with the industrial partners.
Master plan[edit]An overall planning concept for Oberer Eselsberg was developed with all involved parties on the basis of the land utilisation plan.
This includes sustainable enhancing of the campus by developing it into a centre of science and research, as well as a long-term plan for future areas of development.
•Preservation and stabilisation of green areas strengthening of public local traffic opposite to individual traffic: improving provision of public infrastructure through the construction of a tramway to the science park.
•Determination of areas for students' livingResearch profile[edit]Inventions:In 2008, a total of 37 inventions were registered at the University.
monitoring invention compensation and licence payments, tracing payment of invention compensation and distribution of residues to the facilities, processing offers of protection right adoption, etc.
This is an 80-hour course following the curriculum of the German Medical Association, which is taught in 14 themed blocks in four modules.
Another new offer is a three-semester programme in "Commercial Mediation and Organisational Development", which consists of nine modules and follows the guidelines of the Federal Association for Mediation in Commerce and the Workplace.
Within another newly integrated programme on intercultural training, the problems of intercultural communication and interaction were dealt with.
The aim here is to shorten the adaptation phase in a foreign culture during a stay abroad and thereby ease integration into the new studying or working environment.
The most popular in terms of participant numbers was again the "Compact Seminar Emergency Medicine", followed by the course offerings from the International Center for Advanced Studies (ICAS) and the distance learning programmes in actuarial science.
Scientific Computing Centre at Uni Ulm[edit]The Scientific Computing Centre Ulm [German: Ulmer Zentrum für Wissenschaftliches Rechnen (UZWR)] is an interdisciplinary research focus of the University of Ulm.
On the occasion of the celebration of 5 years GUC at the universities Ulm and Stuttgart the partners could be proud of the reached position: In winter semester 2008/2009 nearly 6.
In October 2008, the first class in engineering and in pharmacy and biotechnology graduated together with the second class in management technology.
Professor Ashraf Mansour, Prime Founder of the GUC and Honorary Senator of the University of Ulm, got the Federal Cross of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany for his contribution to the German-Egyptian relations.
Near East/Egypt:In October 2008 the 25 years old exchange with Cairo University was celebrated by a conference titled »Science for Life« with the presence of an Ulm delegation headed by Vice president Prof.
The long-lasting collaboration was the basis for the Ulm participation in the »German-Egyptian Science Year 2007« and the follow-ups in 2008China :The successful cooperation with Chinese partner universities was strengthened.
Chinese partners send doctoral students predominantly to the University of Ulm with own scholarships and thus start building up a lasting research cooperation.
The »International Graduate School in Molecular Medicine Ulm«, financed by the Excellence Initiative, held the second successful Summer Academy in Wuhan at the campus of the partner university HUST, sponsored by the DAAD.
In September 2008 the first Ulm Alumni Clubs have been founded with the presence of an Ulm delegation headed by the Vice-President Professor Stadtmüller at the HUST Tongji Medical Faculty and at the SEU in Nanjing.
The University of Ulm currently holds 101 bilateral agreements with 79 partner universities in 19 European countries.
During 2008, a total of 43 students from these partner universities studied in Ulm, while 54 students from Ulm studied abroad at European partner universities under the ERASMUS programme.
From overseas partners 38 students came to study at the University of Ulm for a full year and 51 students from Ulm took part in our 27 overseas exchange programmes.
The number is further increased by the participants of the mathematics exchange programmes with partner universities in the US.
The »11th International Summer Program at the Ulm University 2008« attracted again 29 students from transatlantic partner institutions.
Academy Fund for Internationalising the University[edit]The Academy for Science, Industry and Technology allocated 100,000 euros out of the »Academy Fund« to the University for the promotion of internationalisation in 2008.
Since it was founded, this non-profit organisation has been raising these funds itself with its successful course programme.
80,000 euros of the fund will be distributed as scholarships, especially to cover tuition fees for international students who are in need of financial aid.
The remaining 20,000 euros are intended for the promotion of international cooperation, for continuing education, development of new programmes and public relations.
Certificate Family Friendly University[edit]The University of Ulm received the basic certificate »Family-Friendly University« on 24 November 2008 on the basis of an audit carried out by the company berufundfamilie gGmbH.
The University of Ulm’s Executive Committee signed an agreement on objectives in which the University of Ulm commits itself to further measures of making more compatible career/ studying and family.
On 30 June 2008, the University Hospital was the first university hospital in Baden-Württemberg to receive the same certificate.
By means of interim reports and another audit after three years, the institutes are required to prove that they implement their self-imposed goals – only then will the final certificate be awarded.
Children's Day-Care Centre:In the children's day-care centre, jointly used by the University Hospital and the University of Ulm, there are 20 spots available for children of employees and young scientists of the University.
The question of subsequent childcare for children who have reached the age of three is becoming increasingly important.
Holiday Childcare:The University administration offered a holiday childcare programme for children of employees, in cooperation with the Workers’ Welfare Organisation (research holidays) and the Centre for General Scientific Continuing Education (Summer Science Camp).
The first associated institution was founded in 1985, the Institute for Laser Technology in Medicine and Measurement Technique (ILM), as a foundation under public law.
As this decision was however not confirmed by the Ministry of Science, Research and Arts of the State of Baden-Württemberg, the university was not renamed to Albert Einstein University of Ulm (German: Albert-Einstein-Universität Ulm) as of July 2007, and stayed as Ulm University.
However, the street on which the main buildings of the Ulm University are located, and thus the physical address of the university, was named "Albert-Einstein-Allee" in honor of Einstein.

The background to the right shows construction works of the Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences (around 1973).
The city’s first real university, however, was only founded in 1965 by adding a combined Faculty of Natural Sciences–Arts and Humanities to the existing medical one.
Only four years later the university split the combined faculty into two separate bodies, which led to the constitution of a Faculty of Arts and Humanities as well as a Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences.
In 1979 a modern University and State Library was opened to the public, and a sports centre was added in 1980/81.
Following a quarrel of more than 23 years, the "nameless" university of Düsseldorf was finally christened after the poet Heinrich Heine, one of Düsseldorf’s most famous sons, in 1989.
Heinrich Heine University’s Faculty of Business Administration and Economics opened in 1990, the Faculty of Law in 1993.
E ("Ort des Austauschs, des Studiums und der Entwicklung") encompasses the library for medical literature and constitutes the centre for studying and learning of the Faculty of Medicine.
Graduate studies have been institutionalised in the form of the faculty-wide Medical Research School Düsseldorf, which offers networking, services and counselling for both graduate students and their supervisors.
Further structured doctorate support is provided by research training groups in neurosciences (RTG 1033, iBrain), in hepatology (research training in CRC 974) and in tumor research (Düsseldorf School of Oncology DSO).
Vogt Institute for Brain Research and the German Diabetes Centre (DDZ) are important organisations that form the local research environment.
The German-French master programme Media Culture Analysis / Analyse de Pratiques Culturelles, enables students to obtain a double diploma of both the HHU and the University of Nantes.
At doctoral level the academy of the Faculty of Arts and Humanities, PhilGrad, offers a broad range of counselling and career-relevant courses.
Further support for structured doctorates provide programmes in the history of art (RTG 1678), in linguistics (research training in CRC 991), in ageing-related studies and in democracy research (Link.
Among the research hubs in the faculty are linguistics (CRC 991), politics (Research Unit 1381), ancient history (funded by the NRW Academy for the Arts and Sciences), the history of art, and editing studies (complete works editions of Max Weber and Martin Buber in progress).
Beyond that, the Faculty of Arts and Humanities contributes to HHU’s Institute of German and International Party Law and Party Research (PRuF).

The faculty has institutionalised support for doctoral studies in the form of iGRAD, the Interdisciplinary Graduate and Research Academy Düsseldorf to establish network structures and offer counselling and training services for doctoral students, supervisors and research training groups.
Research hubs with a significant volume of third-party founded collaborative projects are biology (Cluster of Excellence on Plant Sciences CEPLAS) and physics (CRC-TR 6, CRC-TR 18).
The Biomedical Research Center (BMFZ) and the Bioeconomy Science Center (a cluster of 54 departments of the universities of Aachen, Bonn and Düsseldorf, as well as the Forschungszentrum Jülich) are important organisations forming the local research environment.
Business Administration and Economics[edit]  The Oeconomicum is home to the Faculty of Business Administration and Economics.
One of HHU’s smaller faculties, the Faculty of Business Administration and Economics, attracted about 1,100 students in the winter semester 2011/12.
Further education is provided by the Düsseldorf Business School (DBS), which offers MBA-Programmes against a tuition fee.
Examples are General Management MBAs (in German as well as in English) and Health Management (in cooperation with the Health Care Academy Düsseldorf).
A major research hub in economics is competition economics, funded through the DFG ANR Project and centred in the Düsseldorf Institute for Competition Economics (DICE).
The Faculty of Law offers practically oriented courses for the state examination in law through cooperation with various local institutions (e.
Beyond that, specialties are a German-French course of studies together with the University of Cergy-Pontoise and extra-curricular qualifications in Anglo-American law.
Further education is provided by Düsseldorf Law School (DLS), which offers postgraduate masters in the protection of commercial rights, information rights and medical rights against a tuition fee.
Hubs are the Centre for Information and Technology Law (ZfI), the Centre for Medical Law (IMR), the Insurance Law Institute, and the Institute of German and International Party Law and Party Research (PRuF).
Effective cooperation with university and non-university partners led to a rise in third-party funding from 49 million Euros in 2008 to 67 million Euros in 2011.
CEPLAS will investigate solutions for a resource-efficient plant growth against the backdrop of a growing world population on the one hand and dwindling natural resources on the other.
International[edit]HHU is currently involved in 23 international projects funded within the EU’s Seventh Framework Programme.
Two HHU researchers at the Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences have thus far attained the highest award at European Level, the ERC Advanced Grant.
Young researchers[edit]Three of HHU’s faculties have installed graduate academies to provide the best possible conditions for doctoral work.
These will receive support by the Heine Research Academies (HeRA) network, which will address questions of fundamental importance in doctoral education.
All graduate academies join forces in the effort to assure consistent and reliable quality standards in doctoral education as well as to provide extra-curricular training in interdisciplinary and disciplinary key skills.
Its concept to strengthen an entrepreneurial culture at and around HHU was successful in the EXIST competition of the Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology (Germany).
The Centre for Entrepreneurship Düsseldorf (CEDUS) functions as HHU’s local one-stop shop for all queries related to self-employment and starting one’s own company.
In recent years the university has undertaken substantial efforts to improve study conditions and the quality of teaching through various projects:HHU successfully competed in the Quality Pact for Teaching of the Federal Government and the Länder.
This resulted in a nine-million-Euro grant for the university’s integrated quality improvement scheme "iQu" over the coming five years.
Cornerstones of this project are increased students’ success rates at high levels of academic quality, designing a systematic training concept for all teaching staff, and reinforcing the e-learning and e-teaching concepts already established during the HeinEComp project.
To support new students during their first weeks and months at HHU, senior students have been offering orientation tutorials for several years.
These are meant to communicate both subject-specific studying and working techniques as well as to act as practical guides to the support and service structures of the university.
In addition to academic knowledge, social key competences and language skills are essential prerequisites for a successful start into working life.
This is why HHU offers counselling and training in job-relevant skills through its Careers service, the Languages Centre, the Department German as a Foreign Language, the General Studies Centre, and the job-oriented modular study programme KUBUS.
These services, which are open to all students, have been combined under the roof of the Student Academy since October 2012.
HHU invests up to 300,000 Euros per year to promote teaching and study projects that feature outstanding innovations.
This nationally unique action has so far supported nearly one hundred projects since the implementation of the respective teaching fund in 2008.
The hein@ward for e-teaching and the HHU teaching award, for example, make original teaching and study concepts visible within the university community.
Student Services[edit]The Student Service Centre (SSC) offers counselling and services for 12 hours each day from Monday to Friday.
Beyond this regular service, various events in the course of each academic year address students’ information demands.
Internationality[edit]Strategy and goals[edit]Internationalisation efforts at HHU reflect the university’s goals and measures as formulated in its internationalisation strategy.
Up until 2015 HHU’s internationalisation activities will focus on the areas of undergraduate, graduate, and doctoral studies as well as teaching.
Thereby, bringing together students with different backgrounds plays an important role: HHU not only provides support for students, staff, and teachers planning to spend time abroad, but also engages in the promotion of internationalisation@home experiences.
Measures also include the improvement of extensive assistance for international students, researchers, and guests.
International guests[edit]With 15 per cent of international students, HHU traditionally enjoyed an above-average popularity among German destinations.
Due to the constant rise in higher education demand by German students in recent years, however, this percentage has declined to around 12 per cent.
HHU is a signatory of the National Code of Conduct for German Universities Regarding International Students and fully supports the measures proposed therein.
In detail, HHU students profit from the following measures:•International Student Orientation Service (iSOS): The iSOS provides counselling and practical support in matters related to study offers, visa issues, finding an apartment and language classes.
•Tutorials: HHU offers extra tutorials in subjects with a traditionally high degree of international students to explain programme-specific working and studying methods.
•Career Planning: Towards the end of their studies, students can take the opportunity to learn about methods of job search and letter etiquette for job applications in Germany.
International study programms and doctoral studies[edit]At present five degree programmes at HHU are taught in English: The Faculty of Arts and Humanities offers English Studies (B.
International partners in higher education[edit]Key regions of HHU’s internationalisation activities are Europe, USA, Japan and the Near East.
At the moment there are 13 collaborations at university level, 80 collaborations in research or teaching at faculty or institute level, and over 140 Erasmus partnerships.
Central institutions[edit]Central Administration[edit]The central administration has five departments: student affairs, academic management, personnel and organisation, finance, and facility management.
Furthermore, the chancellor’s three staff offices are responsible for legal advisory, work safety and protection of the environment, and internal auditing.
Current tasks for the university administration are the implementation of a campus management system as well as the renovation and improvement of campus infrastructure.
→ see also: German: Universitäts- und Landesbibliothek DüsseldorfCentre for Information and Media Technology (ZIM)[edit]As a central unit and (multi) media centre of HHU, the ZIM provides competencies and services in the field of digital information delivery and processing.
Botanical Garden[edit]The Botanical Garden of Düsseldorf is a scientific institution of HHU, which cultivates about 6,000 different kinds of plants from all around the globe.
→ see also: German: Botanischer Garten DüsseldorfEqual opportunities[edit]It is a central goal of HHU to ensure the equal treatment of women and men regarding working conditions and career options.
Together with the further improvement of family friendliness, these issues and goals have been formalised in the university’s equal opportunity concept.
The university has been certified for its family friendliness (since 2008, certificate renewed in 2011) and bears the "Total E-Quality" label (since 2007, certificate renewed in 2010).
Concrete equal opportunity measures are the SelmaMeyerMentoring programme, a coaching for female professors, the COMEBACK programme to facilitate the reintegration of young parents in an academic career, and special qualification programmes for female researchers.
A family counselling office was opened in 2006: it organises babysitting for emergency situations, activities for kids during school holidays, and father-and-child activities.
Premises and grounds[edit]HHU’s roughly triangular campus is located in the southeast of Düsseldorf, in the Bilk district.
This unusually direct link between university and university hospital creates a "scientific suburb" on Düsseldorf’s south-eastern border.
At the moment many buildings on campus are being renovated and modernised, especially the lecture halls, four of which will be back in working condition by autumn 2013.
As with many structures of the 1960s and 1970s, the building substance needs to be updated in terms of technical specifications and health requirements.
Already completed are the new Oeconomicum building (Faculty of Business Administration and Economics) and the new O.
library (medical literature) – the latter one of Germany’s most up-to-date structures for individual study and group workCampus culture[edit]Sports are coordinated by the students’ representation (AStA) of Düsseldorf’s four higher education institutions in a joint initiative.
Musical initiatives include the AStA’s Local Heroes event, a platform for local bands, as well as jam sessions.
Since 1989 the Heinrich Heine Guest Lecture has repeatedly drawn high-profile speakers to the university’s campus.
These guest professors usually perform a small series of lectures for the general public on topic(s) that are currently in the focus of public attention.
New traditions have come to supplement the guest lecture: since 2010 the "University Speech" and since 2011 the "Heinrich Heine Professorship for Business and Economics", both performed by external speakers of high calibre.
As a German public university, HHU receives funding from the Land of North Rhine-Westphalia and therefore does not charge tuition fees.
For example, there are bursary programmes to cover living costs, facilitate stays abroad, or to finish one’s final thesis.
Within the National Scholarship Programme at German universities, for example, HHU currently ranks among the top 5 providers of scholarships.
Governance[edit]The President’s Office[edit]Heinrich Heine University Düsseldorf is a public corporation of the Land of North Rhine-Westphalia.
Its degree of autonomy from state ministries and other legal bodies is defined in the Higher Education Autonomy Act (HFG) of 31 October 2006.
It gives advice to the president’s office and supervises their administration of university business (§21,3 HFG).
Current chairperson of the council is Anne-José Paulsen, a judge and president of the Appeal Court of Düsseldorf (Oberlandesgericht Düsseldorf).
The senate[edit]The Senate is the central democratic organ for discussions between the university’s various status groups.
Faculty council[edit]Each faculty council represents the interests of the various status groups within a faculty.
Student representation[edit]The student parliament is the highest plenary organ of all matriculated students at HHU.
The central representative of student life and the voice of students’ demands in university politics is the AStA (Allgemeiner Studierendenausschuss).
One student association for each academic subject represents the interests of the students within the university community.

de Logo of the University of Hamburg Data as of 2013 The University of Hamburg (German: Universität Hamburg) is a comprehensive university in Hamburg, Germany.
It was founded on 28 March 1919, having grown out of the previous General lecture system (Allgemeines Vorlesungswesen) and the Colonial Institute of Hamburg (Hamburgisches Kolonialinstitut) as well as the Akademic Gymnasium.
In spite of its relatively short history, five Nobel Prize Winners and serials of scholars are affiliated to the university.
University of Hamburg is the biggest research and education institution in Northern Germany and one of the most extensive universities in Germany.
The main campus is located in the central district of Rotherbaum, with affiliated institutes and research centres spread around the city state.
Although for a time, senator Werner von Melle supported the merger of existing institutions into one university, this plan failed because of the parliaments composition due to the effects of class voting.
Much of the establishment wanted to see Hamburg limited to its dominant role as a trading center and shunned both the costs of a university and the social demands of the professors that would have to be employed.
Progress was made however, since proponents of a university founded the Hamburg Science Foundation (Hamburgische Wissenschaftliche Stiftung) in 1907 and the Hamburg Colonial Institute in 1908.
The former institution supported the recruitment of scholars for the chairs of the General lecture system and funding of research cruises, and the latter was responsible for all education and research questions concerning overseas territories.
In the same year, the citizenry approved a construction site on the Moorweide for the establishment of a lecture building, which opened in 1911 and later became the Main Building of the university.
However, the plans for the foundation of the university itself had to be shelved, following the outbreak of the First World War.
He and Rudolf Ross made a push for education reform in Hamburg, and their law establishing the university and a Adult high school finally went through.
The first faculties created by the university were Law and Political Science, Medicine, Philosophy and Natural Sciences.
Weimar Republic and National Socialist era[edit]During the Weimar Republic, the university quickly grew into importance.
Several thousand students were continuously enrolled, and it drew scholars like Albrecht Mendelssohn Bartholdy, Aby Warburg and Ernst Cassirer to Hamburg.
Because many students were suffering due to the bad economic situation that prevailed in the early republic, the Hamburg Association of Student Aid was founded in 1922.
Ernst Cassirer became principal of the university in 1929, one of the first Jewish scholars with that role in Germany.
Massive political influence by the Nazis followed, including the removal of books from the libraries and harassment against alleged enemies of the people.
At least ten students working with the White Rose in Hamburg were suspected and arrested; four of them died in custody or were executed.
In the foyer of the lecture hall a design by Fritz Fleer commemorative plate was taken in 1971 in memory of the four resistance fighters.
In the Federal Republic of Germany[edit]  Philosopher's Tower, built in 1962After the Second World War, the university was reopened in the winter of 1945 with 17,800 employees.
Out of the 2,872 students who were enrolled at the University of Hamburg in the first postwar semester of 1945/46, 601 had been admitted at the Philosophical, 952 at the Medical and 812 to the Faculty of Law and Political Science.
The first student association during this period was elected in 1946 under British supervision, and it formed the foundation of the AStA in 1947.
During the West German era, new departments were added to the university, most notably the Faculty of Theology as well as the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences in 1954.
The late 1950s and early 1960s saw a lot of construction: the Auditorium and the Philosopher's Tower where inaugurated near the Von-Melle-Park, while the Botanical Institute and Botanical Garden were relocated to Flottbeck.
A wave of protests during the student movements of 1968 sparked a reform of the university structure, and in 1969 the faculties were dissolved in favor of more interdisciplinary departments.
Student and staff involvement in the administration was also strengthened, and the office of Rektor abolished in favor of a university president.
Further construction in the 1970s also built up the remaining space on the main campus of Rotherbaum quarter, with the Geomatikum building and the Wiwi-Bunker (named for its bunker-like architecture) being the distinctive addition for that decade.
Two newly constructed buildings were opened adjacent to the Main Building in 1998 and 2002, revitalizing the Moorweide area of the university.
In 2005, the Hamburg University of Economy and Politics was merged into the University of Hamburg by a political act that was opposed by both institutions.
The Main Building stands on the Moorweide opposite Hamburg Dammtor station, not far from the main campus at Von-Melle-Park.
The State and University Library Hamburg, the Audimax (Auditorium) and several other teaching buildings are all located in that area.
Several departments are located in other quarters: Physics is spread over branches at Jungiusstraße, Bergedorf (along with the Hamburg Observatory) and Bahrenfeld (with the world-renowned DESY and other facilities).
Academics[edit]  Main Building of the UniversityThe annual recruitment of about 7,000 freshmen contributes to the current total of 41,000 students, out of which 6,000 graduate every year, including around 900 with a doctorate.
With almost 700 professors engaged in teaching and research, the University of Hamburg is the largest in Hamburg.
In addition, over 3,600 academic staff and 6,100 administrative and technical staff members are employed in the university.
The University of Hamburg supports seven Collaborative Research Centres (German: Sonderforschungsbereiche) sponsored by the German Research Foundation.
According to the QS World University Rankings, it was placed 186th globally in 2013, with Arts and Humanities being the highest ranked subjects at 98th place.
A large number of Associated Institutes (An-Institute) stand in liaison with the university, among them the Hans-Bredow-Institut for Media Research and the Heinrich Pette Institute - Leibniz Institute for Experimental Virology.
It is also one of the two founding members of the China-EU School of Law in China, which contains 16 member institutions for providing mid-career training, master's degree and joint doctoral research in China-European Law.

University of Oldenburg, Jump to: navigation, search Carl von Ossietzky Universität OldenburgUni oldenburg logo.
de Data as of 2015   Aerial view of the Carl von Ossietzky Universität OldenburgThe Carl von Ossietzky University of Oldenburg (German: Carl von Ossietzky Universität Oldenburg) is a university located in Oldenburg, Germany.
It is one of the most important and highly regarded educational facilities in northwestern Germany and specialises in interdisciplinary & sustainable development studies and renewable energy studies with focus on solar and wind energy.
During the Weimar Republic, the establishment of the Pedagogical Academy (Pädagogische Akademie) in Oldenburg in 1929 enabled the vocational training of teachers.
The first step towards the university was done on 23 February 1959 with the decision of the city council to launch a university project, which was followed in 1970 with the Memorandum establishing the University of Oldenburg from the Minister of Culture of Lower Saxony.
Enrollment and teaching started in the summer semester of 1974, with an education curriculum for 2,400 students.
In 1991, the university was officially named after the resistance fighter and Nobel laureate Carl von Ossietzky, having been denied to take on his name by previous conservative state governments.
In 2012, the university founded the faculty of medicine and health sciences, introducing a 12-semester course in human medicine, which leads students to the German state examination, Staatsexamen, a prerequisite to practice as a physician.
The new faculty is part of the European Medical School Oldenburg-Groningen (EMS), a cooperation between the University of Oldenburg, the University of Groningen (Netherlands), and local hospitals.
University Profile[edit]  The main building of Uhlhornsweg campus  The main building of Wechloy campus, Faculty of Mathematics and Natural ScienceThe university offers 95 courses of study.
Due to the Bologna Process, in 2004 Oldenburg adopted Bachelor and Masters degrees in place of the former Diplom and Magister.
One main focus of the university is the schooling of teachers, which was established during the 1970s and remains a strong profile, with master's degrees for teaching offered in all faculties.
The PhD program Didactical reconstruction is especially renowned, as is the research in sustainable development, encompassing several academic disciplines.
The campus is split into two locations, the major one being Uhlhornsweg, where the main library, the mensa and the administration along with most of the departments is housed.
Having used the buildings of the former teaching college during the first years, the main buildings of the university were inaugurated in 1982, with ongoing extensions since then, including the main lecture hall in 2001.
The Wechloy campus, also first opened in 1982, is home to the studies of natural sciences as well as the library of natural sciences.
As part of the Universities Excellence Initiative, the university was awarded a Cluster of Excellence for its initiative Hearing4all.
The cluster deals with research into the improvement of speech understanding in background noise and has a funding of €34 million.
The group Gegenlicht runs a cinema in the Old Aula and on campus during the summer, while the programme zwergWERK is focused on the presentation of short films.
It administers the public transport tickets for the student body, offers several forms of student loans and organizes festivities.
In addition, different pasta is served daily, and a selection of high quality, self-composable, courts, at slightly higher prices, is available at the Culinarium.
In 2001, the cafeteria at Uhlhornsweg took first place in the taste category and ended up in second place overall at the German-wide canteen ranking done by UNICUM magazine.
The following years, it steadily dropped, but in 2008, it managed to return to second place overall, and again become first ranked in the taste category.
International Partnerships[edit]The first major cross-border cooperation was started in 1980 with the Rijksuniversiteit Groningen.
It has since then resulted in an especially far-reaching partnership, with several majors jointly offered by the two universities.
Awards[edit]•The annual Klaus-von-Klitzing Award is jointly awarded by the university and the EWE-Foundation for special commitment in the teaching of natural sciences.
•Also annually during each Tag der Chemie (Chemistry Day), the Angelus-Sala Award is award to the high school students of the region who excelled n chemistry class.

svg The Freie Universität Berlin (English: Free University of Berlin, often abbreviated as FU Berlin or simply FU) is a research university located in Berlin and one of the most prominent universities in Germany.
It is internationally known for its research in the humanities and social sciences, as well as in the field of natural and life sciences.
Founded in West Berlin during the early Cold War period, its name refers to city's status as part of the free western world.
Freie Universität Berlin is one of eleven German elite universities in the German Universities Excellence Initiative, a national competition for institutions of higher education.
Winning a distinction for five doctoral programs, three interdisciplinary research clusters and its overall institutional strategy as an "International Network University".
6 Honorary degrees6 Rankings7 See also8 References9 External linksHistory[edit]Freie Universität Berlin was established by students and scholars on 4 December 1948.
The University of Berlin was located in the former Soviet sector of Berlin and was granted permission to continue teaching by the Soviet Military Administration in Germany (SMAD) in January 1946.
The universities were increasingly influenced by communism as they were ground for the political disputes of the postwar period.
Between 1945 and 1948, more than 18 students were arrested or persecuted, some even executed by the soviet secret police (NKVD).
Today, the Hahn-Meitner building houses the Institute for Biochemistry, where the nuclear fission was discovered.
The climax of the protests was reached on 23 April 1948: after three students were expelled from the university without a trial, about 2,000 students protested at the Hotel Esplanade.
On 19 June 1948 the "preparatory committee for establishing a free university" consisting of politicians, professors, administrative staff members and students, met.
With a manifesto titled "Request for establishing a free university in Berlin" the committee appealed to the public for support.
The municipal authorities of Berlin granted the foundation of a free university and requested the opening for the coming winter semester 1948/49.
Meanwhile, the students committee in the German Democratic Republic protested against the formation, the GDR described the new university as the "so-called free university" in official documents until the fall of the Berlin Wall.
This form was unique in Germany at that time, as the students had much more influence on the system than before.
But until the 1970s, the involvement of the students in the committees was slowly cut back while adapting to the model of the western German universities in order to be fully recognized as an equivalent university.
On 15 November 1948, the first lectures were held in the buildings of the Kaiser Wilhelm Society for the Advancement of Science.
The actual foundation took place on 4 December 1948 in the Titania palace, the film theater with the biggest hall available in the western sectors of Berlin.
Attendants of the event were not only scientists, politicians (the Governing Mayor Ernst Reuter amongst others) and students, but also representatives of American universities, among them Stanford University and Yale University.
] must be interested in turning out citizens of the world, men who comprehend the difficult, sensitive tasks that lie before us as free men and women, and men who are willing to commit their energies to the advancement of a free society.
Until the construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961, many students came from the soviet sector, often supported through the "Währungsstipendium" of the senate.
Kennedy was awarded honorary citizen by the Freie Universität and held a ceremonial speech in front of the Henry Ford building in which he addressed the future of Berlin and Germany under the consideration of the motto of the FU.
Amongst the attendant crowd are also the Governing Mayor of Berlin Willy Brandt and the Chancellor of Germany Konrad Adenauer.
Kennedy visited Freie Universität in 1962 for the first time and in June 1964 for receiving his honorary degree from the Department of Philosophy.
 The "Henry Ford" buildingIn the late 1960s, Freie Universität was one of the main scenes of the German student movement of 68 as a reaction to the global student protests during that time.
After the assassination of student Benno Ohnesorg and the attempt on Rudi Dutschke's life, protests quickly escalated to violence in all of Germany.
The events of the 68-movement provided the impulse for more openness, equality, and democracy in German society.
During the 1970s and the 1980s, the university became a "Massenuniversität" (mass/mega university) with 50,298 registered students in 1983.
After reunification, Freie Universität was the second largest university in Germany (after the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich) with 62,072 students in the winter term of 1991/92.
Shortly thereafter, the senate of Berlin decided to drastically reduce the places until 2003, the number of students shrank to 43,885 in the winter term of 2002/03.
The university's research performance increased markedly with regard to the number of graduates, PhDs granted, and publications.
Underlying this successful trend were fundamental reforms such as the introduction of modern management systems in the administration, a reorganization of the departments, and an efficient utilization of resources.
The Prognos AG, the renowned economic consulting corporation founded by the University of Basel, Switzerland, presented Freie Universität with an award for its good entrepreneurial principles.
Recent years (2000-present)[edit]  Main campus in DahlemSince 2003, the FU Berlin has been regrouping its research capacities into interdisciplinary research focus areas called clusters.
Due to financial cutbacks and restructuring of medical schools in the same year, the medical institutions of Freie Universität and the Humboldt University merged to create a joint department, the Charité – Universitätsmedizin Berlin.
In the same year, Freie Universität dedicated a monument to the founding students who were murdered during the protests.
The university presents its Freedom Award to personalities who have made a special contribution toward the cause of freedom.
Based on its founding tradition, the Freie Universität's seal to this day bears the Latin terms for Truth, Justice, and Liberty.
Campuses[edit]Campus Dahlem[edit]  Main entry of the Campus DahlemMost of the facilities of Freie Universität are located in the residential garden district of Dahlem in southwestern Berlin.
Around the beginning of the 20th century, Dahlem was established as a center for research of the highest caliber.
Academic activity in Dahlem was supported by Friedrich Althoff, Ministerial Director in the Prussian Ministry of Culture, who initially proposed the foundation of a "German Oxford".
The first new buildings housed government science agencies and new research institutes of the University of Berlin.
The Kaiser Wilhelm Society – forerunner of the present-day Max Planck Society – was founded in 1911 and established several institutes in Dahlem.
View of the southern Campus Dahlem from the canteen "Mensa I"A dynamic group of researchers carried out pioneering research resulting in numerous Nobel Prizes.
Since its foundation, Freie Universität has been using buildings formerly belonging to the Kaiser Wilhelm Society and, in addition, has added numerous architecturally innovative buildings.
Freie Universität's central campus consists of building ensembles within walking distance of each other (about 1.
The planners oriented themselves along the type of campus found in the United States – a novelty in post-war Germany.
The first independent structure to be completed on campus was the Henry Ford building, funded by the Ford Foundation.
To that point, the university was housed in several older structures around the neighborhood, including the Otto Hahn building, which houses the Department of Biochemistry to this day.
Thanks to further donations from the United States, Freie Universität was able to construct several new central building complexes including the Benjamin Franklin university clinic complex.
The largest single complex of university buildings is the Rost- und Silberlaube, which translates roughly to the "Rust and Silver Lodges".
This complex consists of a series of interlinked structures corresponding to either a deep bronze (hence, "rust") or shiny white ("silver") hue, surrounding a variety of leafy courtyards.
It has been complemented in 2005 by a new centerpiece, the brain-shaped Philological Library, designed by British architect Lord Norman Foster.
Botanical Garden: Tropical GreenhouseWith 43 ha and around 22,000 species of plants, the botanical garden of the FU in the east of Dahlem is one of the biggest of its kind.
The main campus can be reached by public transportation: With the U-Bahn line U3, various busses and the S-Bahn line S1, students can reach the centers of Berlin in under 15 minutes.
Geocampus Lankwitz[edit]The campus in Lankwitz, formerly part of a teacher training college, is now home to the department of Earth sciences and a part of the university archives.
It is 2 km southwest of the main campus and consists of numerous clinics and institutes, amongst them a small animal clinic, a clinic for horses and an institute of poultry diseases.
Campus Benjamin Franklin[edit]Since the formation of the FU in 1948, it has used public hospitals as part of the medical faculty.
Between 1959 and 1969, the "Steglitz Clinic", about 3 km southeast of Dahlem, was built with large financial supports of the United States.
The medical center became one of the biggest European medical establishments unifying all institutes, clinics and lecture halls.
The Berlin Geography Society founded in 1828, the Berlin University for Professional Studies and the German Archeological Institute (DAI) are also located on the campus.
In addition, Dahlem is an important location for the Berlin State Museums group, housing the Ethnological Museum of Berlin and the Museum of Asian Art.
Student Village[edit]Main article: Schlachtensee Student VillageDuring the 1960s, a student village with 27 buildings was constructed near Schlachtensee lake serving as housing opportunities for students.
Libraries[edit]  Interior of the Philological Library designed by Sir Norman FosterSee also: Philological LibraryWith an inventory of 8.
5 million volumes and over 25,000 journals distributed in the central university library (UB) and 49 specialized libraries of the institutes, the library system of the FU is the biggest in Germany.
The UB is granted the status United Nations Depository Library and is linked to the global library system of the UN under direction of the Dag Hammarskjöld Library in New York.
As part of the library of the UN and the EU, it contains all publications of the UN General Assembly, the UN Security Council, the International Court of Justice as well as publications from the Council of Europe and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe.
Although the UB is generally a lending library, some smaller libraries of the departments are so called Präsenzbibliotheken, where students are only able to read books or journals.
It is planned to include all libraries of the natural science departments and the smaller institutes in the humanities (e.
Academics[edit]Admissions[edit]With 33,000 applicants for the undergraduate programs (Bachelor) in 2013, admissions at Freie Universität remain highly competitive as the university only offers about 4,300 places each year.
Due to the high numbers of applicants, most undergraduate programs at Freie Universität have limitations determined through the NC.
The general deadline for students directly from high school applying to limited programs in the coming winter semester is 15 July every year at all universities in Germany.
Critical applicants which just scored slightly below the NC can be invited to an selective interview or an entry exam, depending on the department/faculty.
Applicants at Charité medical school who do not directly fulfill the NC-criteria have to pass an entry exam, which covers the basic fields of Mathematics, Biology, Chemistry and Physics in addition to passing a selective interview.

Academic libraryThe ISQ ("Institut für Schulqualität der Länder Berlin und Brandenburg", Institute for Quality of Schools in Berlin and Brandenburg) is an independent facility on the campus.
It consults local schools and the senate to achieve and develop a high standard of school quality in Berlin and Brandenburg and closely cooperates with the Department of Education and Psychology of the FU.
Today, the Collegium Musicum has around 500 members from all fields of studies who spend their leisure time making music.
Academic organization[edit]With 12 departments (FB) and three interdisciplinary central institutes, the university can be seen as an universitas litterarum (a traditional university where studies in all basic sciences is possible).

Research focuses mainly on the interactive physical, chemical, and biological processes taking place within the Earth, on the Earth's surface, and the Earth's atmosphere, as well as on the interactions between humans and the environment.
•Since 1954, the Institute of Meteorology is the only institution apart from the National Weather Service of the US, who names the low and high pressure systems of the world.
•The "FU-Fighters", a team of scientists and students of the Institute of Computer Science developing autonomous football-playing robots, were very successful in the international RoboCup competition, placing second in 1999, 2000 and 2003.
Since 2006, the "FUmanoids" team are competing in the category "humanoid kidsize" and placed second in the 2009 and 2010 RoboCup, winning the "Technical Challenge" in 2010.
of Political and Social Sciences•Department of Physics •Traditionally rooted in fundamental research, the Department of Physics is divided into the institutes of experimental physics, theoretical physics and physics education.
Major areas of focus in the research activities within the department are solid-state physics, cluster physics, surface physics, biophysics and physics education.
•Department of Political and Social Science •The Otto-Suhr-Institute for Political Science is the biggest political-science institution in Germany.
•Divided into nine units, research at the Institute of Media and Communication Studies focuses on media change, uncertainty, crisis, and risk communication and political communication and transformation of the public sphere.
•Institute of Sociology and the Institute for Social and Cultural Anthropology•Medical School Charité – Universitätsmedizin Berlin •The joint department with the Humboldt University Berlin is now one of Europe's largest university hospitals.
•Department of Veterinary Medicine •The department is one of five sites in Germany offering veterinary education and training and contains 20 academic units.
The veterinary research performed within the department traditionally lies in emphasis especially on food safety and product quality in foods from animal sources.
Despite the variety of subjects, apart from computer science, studies in the field of engineering can only be done at the Technical University or universities of applied science (Fachhochschulen).
Institute for Latin American StudiesTeaching and learning[edit]Freie Universität operates on a semester calendar where the winter term begins on 1 October and ends on 31 March.
The time where lectures are being held varies each year, normally beginning around mid-October and ending as early as mid-February.

Due to the Bologna process, most of the undergraduate programs are now leading to the three-year Bachelor's degree with 180 ECTS.
At Freie Universität, Bachelor programs are generally divided into three categories: a regular Bachelor called "Mono-Bachelor", a combined Bachelor ("Kombi-Bachelor") consisting of two fields of studies and a combined Bachelor with a teaching option.
Besides the core subject(s), all students are required to complete a series of courses related to general professional skills (ABV).
In the fields of Medicine, Veterinary Medicine, Dentistry, Pharmacy and the law, students enroll in programs with Staatsexamen.
•Master in Cerebrovascular Medicine at Charité in cooperation with the Max Delbrück Center for Molecular Medicine (MDC).
One of the courtyards in the SilberlaubeFreie Universität does not charge any tuition fees in the classical sense.
It consists of an enrollment/re-registration fee, a contribution to the student union (Studentenwerk), a contribution for the student government and the fee for the semester ticket (public transportation pass) for the current semester.
The fees for the semester ticket is defined by a contract with the local transportation company, the Verkehrsverbund Berlin-Brandenburg and allows students to move freely in the ABC zones of Berlin.
Since 2011, Freie Universität participates in the national "Germany Scholarship" program organized by the federal government, universities and numerous private companies.
Research[edit]The annual national and international rankings, the various collaborative research centers funded by German Research Foundation DFG and the state and the numerous laureates make Freie Universität one of the most successful and prominent establishments of research in Germany.
In terms of external endowments by the DFG, Freie Universität ranks third behind the RWTH Aachen University and LMU Munich.
Between 2009 and 2013, 289 foreign guest researchers came to the university through fellowships granted by the renowned Alexander von Humboldt Foundation, making the FU the most popular destination for foreign researchers in Germany.
Excluding the Charité medical school, which is co-administered by the university with the Humboldt University, Freie Universität is currently the lead university for eight collaborative research centers of the German Research Foundation and also has five DFG research units.
Over the course of one week, international renowned scientists and Nobel laureates come together and discuss current problems in all fields of studies.
The annual "Einstein Lectures Dahlem" hosted by the university and several external institutions since 2005 are dedicated to Albert Einstein, who was the director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute of Physics for more than 15 years.
Global partnerships[edit]Freie Universität maintains wide-ranging international contacts to top universities and organizations which provide key impulses for research and teaching.
The university is a founding member of the global educational center for the study of transnational law, the Centre for Transnational Legal Studies in London.
The newly established Centre for International Cooperation (CIC) concentrates on identifying new strategic partners for international projects.
Today, Freie Universität has established over 400 partnerships in five continents, many of them as part of the European ERASMUS program.
For the grant programs in Germany, Freie Universität is one of the first choices both for the ERASMUS and Tempus as well as for the Fulbright program and the international programs of the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD).
An International Summer and Winter University (FUBiS) has been set up for international students offering (semi-)intensive German courses and numerous subject courses.
International Branch Offices[edit]The Freie Universität Berlin operates foreign branch offices in New York City, Brussels, Moscow, Beijing, Cairo, and New Delhi.
The foreign branch offices work to expand upon cooperation partnerships already existing with universities in the country.
In April 2005, the Freie Universität Berlin, in conjunction with Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität (LMU Munich), opened a joint representative office in New York.
This German University Alliance, located in German House, the seat of the German Consulate General and the German UN Mission, represents the interests of the two universities in the United States and Canada and works to increase the exchange of students and scientists.
In addition, Freie Universität Berlin, as the first German institution of higher education, founded an alumni- and fundraising organization, the Friends of the Freie Universität Berlin (FFUB) in New York.
Since 2003 this alumni- and fundraising organization has maintained close contact to alumni and scientists of the Freie Universität in the U.
Some of the proceeds from these fundraising activities were contributed to the renovation of the Henry Ford Building.
Its objectives include the promotion of knowledge of Chinese culture, the cultivation of Chinese-German cooperation, and the spread of Chinese language.
Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, has a Berlin program (Duke in Berlin), that is held in cooperation with the Freie Universität and Humboldt Universität.
At the Freie Universität the UC System maintains an office to attend to the needs of the exchange students from California.
The Office of Global Programs of Columbia University in New York administrates the Berlin Consortium for German Studies.
Notable people[edit]Alumni of Freie Universität include many scientists, philosophers and politicians, amongst them five Nobel Prize winners and 15 Leibniz laureates.
Whitesides by the Department of Biology, Chemistry, PharmacyRankings[edit]  Since 2007 the Freie Universität Berlin is a German University of Excellence.
Freie Universität Berlin is consistently ranked among Germany's top ten universities overall, with particularly strengths in the arts & humanities followed by the social sciences internationally.
In the German "ExcellenceRanking" of the CHE (Center for Higher Education Development) in 2013, Freie Universität ranks top in the fields of Biology, Chemistry, Physics and Political science.
In the CHE "SubjectRanking", Freie Universität has been evaluated as one of Germany's best universities in Earth sciences, Computer science and Philosophy and also ranks among the Top 5 in Psychology, English studies and Education.
In the QS WUR 2014, Freie Universität was placed at the 81–90 slot being the fifth German university ranked in the list.
According to the British Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2017 the FU Berlin ranks 75th globally (including a Top25 position for Arts and Humanities) and fifth in Germany.
Because of an unresolved dispute over the Nobel laureates before the Second World War (both Humboldt and Freie Universität claim to be the rightful successor of the University of Berlin), they do not appear in the Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU), anymore.

de University of Würzburg logo The Julius Maximilian University of Würzburg (also referred to as the University of Würzburg, in German Julius-Maximilians-Universität Würzburg) is a public research university in Würzburg, Germany.
The University of Wurzburg is one of the oldest institutions of higher learning in Germany, having been founded in 1402.
This name is taken from Julius Echter von Mespelbrunn, Prince-Bishop of Würzburg, who reestablished the university in 1582, and Prince Elector Maximilian Joseph, the prince under whom secularization occurred at the start of the 19th century.
The University’s central administration, foreign student office, and several research institutes are located within the area of the old town, while the new liberal arts campus, with its modern library, overlooks the city from the east.
The university today enrolls approximately 29,000 students, out of which more than 1,000 come from other countries.
History[edit]Establishment in 1402[edit]  Old University, drawing from the 17th or 18th centuryAlthough the university was first founded in 1402, it was short-lived.
Jacob, held the then dissolute student lifestyle responsible for the premature decline of the city's first university.
In the Annales Hirsaugiensis Chronologia Mystica of 1506 he cites bathing, love, brawling, gambling, inebriation, squabbling, and general pandemonium as "greatly impeding the academic achievement in Würzburg".
Evidence of this is provided by the fatal stabbing of the university's first chancellor, Johann Zantfurt, in 1413, by a scholar's unruly assistant, or famulus, evidently the result of these very influences.
Despite Egloffstein's thwarted first attempt at founding a university, the city still boasts one of the oldest universities in the German-speaking world, almost on a par with Prague (1348), Vienna (1365), Heidelberg (1386), Cologne (1388), and Erfurt (1392).
A "second founding" by Prince Bishop Julius Echter von Mespelbrunn (1545–1617) in 1582 offered the institution guaranteed autonomous self-government.
The university was fiercely Roman Catholic and initially considered a "bastion of Catholicism in the face of Protestantism", words also used in the university charter which prevented all non-Catholics from graduating from or receiving tenure at the Alma Julia.
Over a century would pass before the university opened its doors to non-Catholics, in keeping with the spirit of Enlightenment encouraged by Prince Bishop Friedrich Karl von Schönborn's newly formulated students' charter of 1734.
The resultant increase in religious tolerance even enabled the summoning and subsequent appointment of the famous physician, Karl Kaspar von Siebold, under Schönborn's successor, Adam Friedrich von Seinsheim.
Shortly after his arrival in 1769, Protestant medical students were permitted to study for their doctorates at the university.
Würzburg's increasing secularisation as a bishopric and its eventual surrender to Bavarian rule at the beginning of the 19th century resulted in the loss of the university's Roman Catholic character.
The end of the city's status as a Grand Duchy under Ferdinand of Toscana in 1814 heralded the Alma Julia's ideological transition to the non-denominational establishment which endures to this day.
This new inclusiveness towards professors and students alike was instrumental in the resultant upturn in all areas of research and education in the 19th century.
Since then, the university has borne the name of its second and most influential founder, officially known as the Julius-Maximilians-Universität of Bavaria.
Their progress culminated in the discovery of x-rays by physicist Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen, first winner of the Nobel Prize for Physics, in 1895.
Röntgen's discovery, which he dubbed a "new kind of ray", is regarded as the university's greatest intellectual achievement, and, simultaneously, a scientific development of huge global import.
Röntgen's successors, namely Wilhelm Wien, Johannes Stark and the chemists Emil Fischer and Eduard Buchner, also number among the succession of Nobel Prize winners to lecture at the university, a tradition which endures in the modern-day example of Klaus von Klitzing.
1945 to today[edit]After World War II, the free state of Bavaria invested a fortune in the rebuilding and renovation of the university buildings, which had been severely damaged by Allied bombing.
The eventual rebuilding of the Neubaukirche ("Neubau Church"), also affiliated to the legal faculty and almost razed to the ground in 1945, marked the end of the city's extensive reconstruction process.
In 1970 it was decided that the church, one of the most important examples of 16th century vaulted architecture in southern Germany, should fulfill a dual function as a place of worship and as the university banquet, assembly, and concert hall.
Echter's heart, removed for safekeeping during the war, has once again found its place in the church he designed, fulfilling a request made during his lifetime.

In 1865, Grand Duke Friedrich I of Baden raised the school to the status of a Hochschule, an institution of higher education.
In 1885, it was declared a Technische Hochschule, or institute of technology, and in 1967 it became an Universität, a full university, which gave it the right to award regular doctorate degrees.
The Victoriapensionat IThe University of Karlsruhe has been one of the leading German institutions in computer science.
The department of informatics was established three years later, along with the first regular course in informatics.
The Institut für Meteorologie und Klimaforschung (Institute for Meteorology and Climate Research) was founded at the university in 1985.
Institute for Electric Engineering at KITThe university also cooperated extensively with the Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe (Karlsruhe Research Centre), and this relationship was formalised on 6 April 2006 when Professor Horst Hippler and Dr.
Sigurd Lettow from Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe signed a contract for the foundation of the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT).
The name was chosen in emulation of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), the leading technical university in the United States.
In February 2008, the merger of the university and the research centre to form KIT was agreed by the state of Baden-Württemberg and Germany's federal government.
In the background, the Karlsruhe Palace that belongs to the KIT campusThe main reason for establishing KIT was to strengthen Karlsruhe's position in the German Universities Excellence Initiative, which offered elite universities grants of up to 50 million euros per annum.
This aim was not achieved: while the University of Karlsruhe was chosen for the initiative in 2006/2007, KIT failed to secure a place in 2012.
In 2008, Hans-Werner Hector, co-founder of SAP, raised 200 million euros to support researchers at the institute.
(Hector is the only founder of SAP who did not graduate from the University of Karlsruhe; he was given an honorary doctorate for his support of intellectually gifted children in 2003.
) Fridericiana, founded in 1825Admission and education[edit]Since the winter semester of 2008/2009, KIT has completed the change from the Diplom system to a bachelor and master system.
Students already enrolled for a diplom degree when the transition began were allowed to finish their studies, but new students are only allowed to apply for a bachelor or master's degree.
All courses require a minimum number of passed exams, called Orientierungsprüfung or orientation assessment, in the first three semesters before students are allowed to complete their course.
A substantial drop-out rate occurs for some engineering courses due to the immense study requirement to pass the prerequisites.
In the first semesters of a course, education tends to be theoretically oriented at KIT, with a high concentration of mathematics for engineering and natural science courses.
Otto Amman Place at KITInterdisciplinary education and research[edit]The university allows a broad range of education with the possibility of cross studies and work.
The studium generale (English: general studies) was established in 1949, allowing students to attend lectures not directly pertaining their study field.
The Zentrum für Angewandte Kulturwissenschaft und Studium Generale (Centre for Applied Culture and General Studies) was founded in 1989 to support the students as a central institution for their interdisciplinary study.
In 1979, the Interfakultatives Institut für Anwendungen der Informatik (Interfaculty Institute for Applications of Informatics) was founded.
Its mathematical pendant is the Institut für Wissenschaftliches Rechnen und Mathematische Modellbildung (Institute for Scientific Calculations and Mathematical Modelling).
Its aim is to enhance the exchange between mathematics and engineering in the fields of scientific calculations.
The Interfakultatives Institut für Entrepreneurship (Interfaculty Institute for Entrepreneurship) was established by SAP funding.
It merges the fields of material sciences, biology, chemistry, engineering, and physics which are related to nano technology.
The CFN is one of the three Exzellenzzentren (English: Excellence Instituitions) of the University of Karlsruhe.
Another interdisciplinary institution is the Centre for Disaster Management and Risk Reduction Technology (CEDIM).
The Karlsruhe School of Optics and Photonics (KSOP) was established in 2006 as a publicly funded project by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft under the German Universities Excellence Initiative.
KSOP was the first graduate school at the University of Karlsruhe and covers photonic materials and devices, advanced spectroscopy, biomedical photonics, optical systems and solar energy.
It is also a partner in the EUROPHOTONICS consortium, which provides scholarship for master's degrees and PhD under the European Commission's prestigious Erasmus Mundus cooperation and mobility program.
KIT operates several TCCON stations as part of an international collaborative effort of measuring greenhouse gases globally.
Reputation[edit]KIT is one of the leading universities in the engineering and natural sciences in Europe, ranking sixth overall in citation impact.

In the 2013 QS World University Rankings, the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology achieved 116th place in the global ranking across all disciplines and 33rd place in the engineering sciences.
As in 2012, KIT (world rank 61) remained ranked as the top university for engineering sciences in Germany, before the RWTH Aachen (world rank 89), the Technical University of Munich (world rank 94) and the Technical University of Dresden (world rank 108).
For the natural sciences, KIT (world rank 51) leads the domestic comparison against the LMU Munich (world rank 62), the University of Heidelberg (world rank 72), and the Technical University of Munich (world rank 81).
According to the Ranking of Scientific Impact of Leading European Research Universities, an official document compiled by the European Commission, Karlsruhe ranks second nationally and sixth in Europe in terms of scholarly impact.
With the exception of the department of biology, this university receives more funding from the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft than any other university specializing in the natural sciences in Germany.
In the engineering sciences (computer science, electrical and mechanical engineering), the university is in the top three together with University of Stuttgart and the RWTH Aachen.
It also consistently ranks top in the course industrial engineering and management, concerning the overall study situation, as well as popularity with employers.
In 1998, Science Watch described its chemistry faculty as belonging to "the cream of the crop in chemistry" internationally.
In 2006, the University of Karlsruhe was chosen to be one of the first three universities with the best future concept within the scope of the German Universities Excellence Initiative.
For many years, the department for Computer Science has been the number-one institution in this field in Germany.
Campus Nord[edit]  KIT locations in Germany and KarlsruheThe Campus Nord (English: Campus North), the former Forschungszentrum was founded in 1956 as Kernforschungszentrum Karlsruhe (KfK) (Karlsruhe Nuclear Research Centre).
Initial activities concentrated around the Forschungsreaktor 2 (FR2), the first nuclear reactor built by Germany.
With the decline of nuclear energy activities in Germany, Kernforschungszentrum Karlsruhe directed its work increasingly towards alternative areas of basic and applied sciences.
This change is reflected in the change of name from Kernforschungszentrum Karlsruhe to Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe with the subheading Technik und Umwelt (technology and environment) in 1995.
The Campus Nord is the site of the main German national nuclear engineering research centre and the Institute for Transuranium Elements.
Computer facilities[edit]The Steinbuch Centre for Computing (SCC), named after Karl Steinbuch, is the institution which was formed in 2008 out of the merging process between the main computer facilities of the University of Karlsruhe and the Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe.
It is responsible for the university's IP connectivity and provides central services (Mail, Web, Campus management) for students and employees.
It supplies students with 10 fully equipped computer rooms, one professional print office and a wireless network over the whole campus area.

de/en Figures as of April 2016 The University of Passau (Universität Passau in German) is a public research university located in Passau, Lower Bavaria, Germany.
Founded in 1973, it is the youngest university in Bavaria and consequently has the most modern campus in the state.
4 Traditions6 References7 External linksHistory[edit]The university was established on 1 January 1973 by a resolution of the Bayerischer Landtag (Bavarian State Parliament).
However its history goes back to 1622 when an Institute for Catholic Studies was incorporated into the Gymnasium founded by Fürst Leopold in 1612.
Under the Nazi regime the university was forced to change its logo, but in 1950 a new seal was introduced, representing Mary with The Child Jesus vanquishing evil.
The strong religious symbolism of this logo was considered inappropriate for the new university and replaced with a neutral logo.
With the exception of the Department of Catholic Theology, which is in the Old Town, and a number of offices in the city centre, all faculties are situated on a single campus along a single street.
This is advantageous for the internal communication of students and staff, particularly because the university offers many interdisciplinary courses.
Hence, it is not uncommon for law courses to be held in the Philosophicum (Arts and Humanities building) and vice versa.
The Nikolakloster buildingThe Nikolakloster building is the oldest building on campus, existing long before the university was established.
The latest addition to the campus, inaugurated in 2014, is the Centre for Media and Communication, which houses a state-of-the-art newsroom.
The university's sports facilities include four gymnasiums, a football pitch and an athletics field with a race track.
The refectoryA wide range of sports courses are offered throughout the semester and are free to staff and students, including football, volleyball, basketball, rowing, martial arts and aerobics.
The campus additionally has four cafeterias, which offer sandwiches, confectionery, coffee, soft drinks and – this being Bavaria – beer.
It is unusual for a German university to have day care facilities, but the reasonably-priced service is well used by students with toddlers aged 1 to 3.
Library[edit]The library was established together with the university in 1978 and opened its doors to students and citizens of Passau the same year.
The central library is the main library of the university and, together with the five faculty and institute libraries, constitutes the university's library system.
There are a total of 1,000 desk spaces for library users in the reading rooms, which are open 16 hours a day.
The president and vice presidents are senators ex officio, as are the deans of the faculties, and the university's gender equality officer.
Faculties[edit]  Philosophicum (Arts and Humanities building)The University of Passau has four faculties: Law, Business Administration and Economics, Arts and Humanities, and Computer Science and Mathematics.
Catholic Theology; Education; Cultural Studies; Governance and Historical Studies; and Languages, Textual Analysis and Media.
The Department of Catholic Theology now offers catholic religious education as a specialisation for students enrolled in one of the teacher training programmes or the M.
The university maintains co-operative partnerships with some 200 foreign universities in the Americas, Europe, Asia and Australia, enabling students enrolled at the university to spend part of their studies abroad.
Student life[edit]Student associations[edit]The university supports a number of student groups in various fields of interest.
Sports[edit]Despite the wide range of sports offered in the Sports Center of the university, there are only two teams that play at a competitive level.
However, it should be kept in mind that unlike other countries, Germany does not have a long tradition of inter-university sporting competitions.
•American Football – Passau Red Wolves•Lacrosse PassauFraternities[edit]Fraternities have a long-standing tradition in Germany's student life, although the usage of the word carries very different connotations from that in the United States.
Students who are members of fraternities often have somewhat conservative political attitudes, sometimes combined with traditional religious views.
Boiotro (affiliated with the Kartellverband katholischer deutscher Studentenvereine)•Burschenschaft Hanseatia•Akad.
Another traditional part of Passau's student life are the Orientation Weeks, intended to acquaint new students with Passau and its university.
During those weeks students are offered guided tours of the university, libraries, the city and of course the bars and clubs.
de Saarland University (German: Universität des Saarlandes) is a modern research university located in Saarbrücken, the capital of the German state of Saarland, and Homburg.
It was founded in 1948 in Homburg in co-operation with France and is organized in eight faculties that cover all major fields of science.
The university is particularly well known for research and education in computer science, computational linguistics and materials science, consistently ranking among the top in the country in those fields.
Thanks to bilingual German and French staff, the University has an international profile, which has been underlined by its proclamation as "European University" in 1950 and by establishment of Europa-Institut as its "crown and symbol" in 1951.
Nine academics have been honored with the highest German research prize, the Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Prize, while working at Saarland University.
At the time the Saarland found itself in the special situation of being partly autonomous and linked to France by economic and monetary union.
With its combination of the German and French educational traditions and the dual languages of instruction, the university had a European perspective right from the start.
In the 1950s Saarland University joined the Association of West-German Universities and accepted a new, more centralized organizational structure.
Research[edit]Saarland University is known for research in Computer Science, nano technology, medicine, European relations, politics and law.
The university campus and the surrounding area is home to several specialized research institutes, affiliated with various high-profile independent research societies and private companies, focused on primary and applied research.
Education[edit]  A view of the main campus from the nearby hillsWith its numerous degree programmes and the variety of final qualifications offered (Diplom, Magister, Ph.
, state examinations and, increasingly, bachelor and master qualifications), Saarland University provides the broad spectrum of disciplines typical of a classical universitas litterarum.
In the area of teacher training, Saarland University offers an integrated bilingual (French-German) course for prospective teachers of geography and history.
A further distinctive feature of Saarland University is the fact that the university is able to award French degrees in subjects such as Droit, Allemand and Lettres modernes.
The Europa-Institut is among the very few socio-economic research centers to focus primarily on European integration.
Its European law and MBA in European Management programmes uniquely focus on opportunities emerging from an expanding and more integrated Europe.
The university is also responsible for conducting Computer Science related courses for students enrolled in the graduate programmes of the MPI for Computer Science and MPI for Software Systems.
Saarland University is one of the few universities in Germany where the entire master's programme in Computer Science is taught in English.
Further, the university has senate and a number of councils dealing with problems ranging from distance learning to women's issues.
Points of Interest and Recreation[edit]The main campus in Saarbrücken is just outside the city, set between picturesque hills.
Cycling from the university to the city or short wander in the forest close to campus is a favorite of students and faculty.
•Botanischer Garten der Universität des Saarlandes, the university's botanical garden•The Hermann-Neuberger-Sportschule is located next to the campus and hosts the Olympiastützpunkt Rheinland-Pfalz/Saarland that is the Olympic Training Center for Rheinland-Pfalz and Saarland.

The name Technische Universität Dresden has only been used since 1961; the history of the university, however, goes back nearly 200 years to 1828.
This makes it one of the oldest colleges of technology in Germany, and one of the country’s oldest universities, which in German today refers to institutes of higher education which cover the entire curriculum.
The university is one of the eleven German universities which succeeded in the Excellence Initiative in 2012, thus getting the title of a "University of Excellence".
The TU Dresden succeeded in all three rounds of the German Universities Excellence Initiative (Future Concept, Graduate Schools, Clusters of Excellence).

In 1871, the year the German Empire was founded, the institute was renamed the Royal Saxon Polytechnic Institute (Königlich-Sächsisches Polytechnikum).
TH Dresden 1905Upon German reunification in 1990, the university had already integrated the College of Forestry (Forstliche Hochschule), formerly the Royal Saxony Academy of Forestry, in the nearby small town of Tharandt.
Some faculties were newly founded: the faculties of Information Technology (1991), Law (1991), Education (1993) and Economics (1993).
Almost all faculties are located on the main campus South of the city center, except for the Faculty of Medicine which has its own campus near the Elbe river East of the city center and the Department of Forestry in Tharandt.
Sciences[edit]With 4,390 students the Faculty of Mathematics and the Natural Sciences is the second-largest faculty at the university.
In October 2006 the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft decided to fund a new graduate school, the Dresden International Graduate School for Biomedicine and Bioengineering and a so-called cluster of excellence From Cells to Tissues to Therapies.
•The Faculty of Computer Science comprises six departments: Applied Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence, Software- and Multimedia-Technology, Systems Architecture, Computer Engineering and Theoretical Computer Science.
Its history goes back to the foundation of the Royal Saxon Academy of Forestry (Königlich-Sächsische Forstakademie) in 1816.
•The Faculty of Transport and Traffic Sciences “Friedrich List” is the only of its kind in Germany covering transport and traffic from economy and system theory science to electrical, civil and mechanical engineering.
Humanities and Social Sciences[edit]•The Faculty of Economics comprises five departments, Business Education Studies (Wirtschaftspädagogik), Business Management, Economics, Management Information Systems and Statistics.
•The Faculty of Languages, Literature and Culture is structured into five departments, American Studies, English Studies, German Studies, Philology, Romance Languages and Slavistics.
The TU Dresden has partially compensated the closure by establishing a private law school•The Faculty of Philosophy comprises seven departments, Art History, Communications, History, Musicology, Political Sciences, Sociology and Theology.
•The School of International Studies is a so-called central institution of the university coordinating the law, economics and political sciences departments for courses of interdisciplinary international relations.

The TU Dresden benefits from the strong research tradition in microelectronics and transport sciences in the Dresden area, but also from the establishment of new research fields such as Biotechnology.
The Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft supports the university in many areas and TU Dresden cooperates closely with renowned research institutes such as Fraunhofer Society, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Scientific Community and Max Planck Society.
Biotechnology and Medical Technology[edit]The university has established a strong partnership with the Max Planck Institute for Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics in molecular bioengineering.
Magnetism and Material Sciences[edit]The Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft funds research in the area of electromagnetic flow influence in metallurgy, artificial crystal formation and electrochemistry.
Micro and Nanotechnology[edit]Silicon Saxony is the biggest cluster of the microelectronics industries in Europe.
TU Dresden is incorporated in this network with three departments of the Faculties of Electrical Engineering and Sciences.
Together with the Fraunhofer Center for Nano-electronic technologies (CNT) it represents one of the leading universities in the field of nanotechnology.
Other research areas[edit]The university has a partnership with the Fraunhofer-Institut for Transport and Infrastructure systems to research on IT-systems for public transport in Dresden.
In partnership with TU Dresden, the Ifo Institute of Economic Research (Ifo Institut für Wirtschaftsforschung e.
The university belongs to a consortium of European Universities offering the Erasmus Mundus Joint Doctoral Programme IT4BI-DC for Business Intelligence.
It has a high reputation in technical fields such as electrical engineering, computer science, photo optics, engine construction and traffic logistics.
Until 2020 more than 1,000 jobs are to be cut at Saxon universities, including Dresden University of Technology.
Since March 2012, every single new or extended employment contract needs to be personally approved by the Minister-President of Saxony.
The Minister-President of Saxony promised to end this situation in case the university achieves what media often call an elite status in the German excellence initiative.
The Center of Biotechnology ("BIOTEC") is a unique interdisciplinary center focusing on research and teaching in molecular bioengineering.
The BIOTEC hosts top international research groups dedicated to genomics, proteomics, biophysics, cellular machines, tissue engineering, and bioinformatics.
The university is currently developing new strategies to make itself more independent from state funding and decision making.
As one of the first universities in Germany it has opened a branch in Hanoi, Vietnam offering a Master's course in mechatronics.
These German semi-public institutes hire their team leaders globally and settle freely within Germany and the city of Dresden has appealed to an unmatched absolute number of them.
Building on that circle the university and non-university institutions formed Dresden Concept to strengthen international awareness and the position in applications for the German excellence initiative.
The characteristic focus on the technical and nature-science subjects of almost all quality-endeavours displeased especially students from other subjects who have to suffer most from reorganization, cancellation and shortage of qualified staffmembers.
Campus[edit] SLUB — Saxon State Library - Regional and University Library DresdenTU Dresden is a campus university in most aspects.
The main campus, as well as the medical faculty and that of Computer Science, are all within the boundaries of the city of Dresden.
The main campus is located South of the city center, mostly in the area bordered by Nöthnitzer Straße, Fritz-Förster-Platz and Münchner Platz; the medical faculty can be found in the Johannstadt district.
The faculty of forestry, formerly the Royal Saxon Academy of Forestry, resides in a forest area in the nearby town of Tharandt.
Ranked by countries the largest group of students comes from China (710), followed by Poland (294), Vietnam (196), Bulgaria (160) and Russia (154).
The university is also quite popular among Central and East European countries such as the neighboring Czech Republic or Ukraine.
Also, through the Erasmus programme and partnerships with universities in the USA, there are many English, French and Spanish speaking students.
To prepare for admissions to the university, many foreign students attend German language courses at the University affiliated language school TUDIAS-Sprachschule.
International students interested in TU Dresden should visit the websites of the "Akademisches Auslandsamt" (International office) for more information.
A number of activities for international students facilitates their integration and help students to find new friends.
Most notably the Erasmus-Initiative TU Dresden offers many group activities throughout the semester which are open to all students (not only to Erasmus participants).
A student run program, the LinkPartnerProgramm matches every interested international student with a German student, to help him or her with questions arising during the first weeks, be it regarding course registration or any other issue students might have.
There are cafeterias as at most universities and the largest refectory can compete with some restaurants even as far as menu size.
[citation needed]Performing Arts Ensembles[edit]Among the many groups at the TU Dresden are four major ensembles.
These four include the theater group "Die Bühne" which has a small ensemble directed by professionals, and the folk dance group "Folkloretanzensemble Thea-Maass" which is dedicated to reviving regional styles of dance.
The last two groups are the largest by far and these are the University Choir and the University Orchestra, both having student and non-student members of all ages.
In 1997 a part of the University Orchestra branched off into a chamber ensemble, becoming the "TU-Kammerphilharmonie", and since it consists almost exclusively of students the ensemble rehearses and performs only during the academic year.

The city of Mannheim, founded in 1606, was fortified and at the present site of the Mannheim Palace a fortress called Friedrichsburg was located, sometimes serving as alternative residence for the Elector, one of the most important territorial princes of the Holy Roman Empire.
had confessional controversies with the inhabitants of his capital city Heidelberg, he decided to appoint Mannheim the Palatinate's new capital in year 1720.
The overall building process was intended to cost about 300,000 Gulden, financed by an extraordinary "palace tax" (Schlossbausteuer), but in the end, the palace cost totalled more than 2,000,000 Gulden and severely worsened the Palatinate's financial situation.
Charles Theodore, Count Palatine of Sulzbach and Founder of the "Theodoro-Palatinae" as painted by Johann Georg ZiesenisThe final construction was not completed until 1760.
Karl Philip died in 1742 and was succeeded by a distant relative, the young Count Palatine of Sulzbach and later Duke of Bavaria Charles Theodor.
Under the initiative of the Alsacian scholar Johann Daniel Schöpflin and following the general acadamization movement in Europe, Prince Charles Theodor established the Palatine Academy of the Sciences Mannheim (Kurpfälzische Akademie der Wissenschaften) on October 17, 1763.
The so-called Academia Electoralis Scientiarum et Elegantiorum Literarum Theodoro-Palatinae, shortened "Theodoro Palatinae" concentrated on the teaching of Natural Sciences and History, and soon earned itself a reputation which reached far beyond the borders of Charles Theodor's realm.
In 1778, a second school was established at Mannheim's palace – the Commercial School (Großherzogliche Handelsschule) – that served as school for merchant sons and which was later named into "Grand-Ducal Commercial Academy".
Further associated institutions included the Mannheim Observatory, the Ducal Natural History Collection, the Ducal Physical Cabinet, the Mannheim Palace Botanical Garden and the in 1769 founded Mannheim Academy of Fine Arts.
The establishment of the Theodoro-Palatinae had a strong cultural and educational policy link and intended to foster the sciences and arts in the Palatinate.
Under Charles Theodor's reign the academy received enormous funding of more than 35,000,000 Gulden and contributed considerably to the cultural, economical and infrastructural development of Southern Germany during the second half of the eighteenth century.
The glamour of the Elector's court and Mannheim's then famous cultural life lasted until 1778 when Charles Theodor became Elector of Bavaria by inheritance and moved his court to Munich.
During Napoleon's reorganization of Germany, the Electorate of the Palatinate was split up and Mannheim became part of the Grand Duchy of Electorate-Bavaria, thus losing its capital/residence status.
Although Mannheim kept the title of "residence", the Mannheim Palace was used merely as accommodation for several administrative bodies.
In addition, the reorganization of the Palatinate and Bavaria made the Bavarian Academy of Sciences and Humanities a major concurrent for academic funding.
The consequences of religious strife, increased rivalry for funding and the Napoleonic Wars put an end to the "Theodoro-Palatinae", which was finally closed on February 17, 1803 after forty years of existence.
20th century[edit] Otto Beck - Senior mayor of Mannheim (1891-1908) and one of the Founding Fathers of the Handelshochschule MannheimFor most of the 19th and early 20th centuries, the palace served no uniform purpose, being used as a representative building and a museum for the city.
Although there was no continuous existence of a scientific college in Mannheim, the newly established Handelshochschule Mannheim, or Municipal Commercial College Mannheim, founded in 1907, saw itself in the tradition of Carl Theodor's earlier colleges.
The Handelshochschule was founded under an initiative from Mannheim's senior mayor Otto Beck (1846–1908) and the Heidelberg's economics professor Eberhard Gothein (1853–1923).
This situation changed in mid-1933 when the social democratic municipal administration of Heidelberg and Mannheim was banished and replaced by a national socialistic one that pushed the merging process forward.
Otto Selz - Last Director of the Handelshochschule Mannheim before its closureDirector of the Handelshochschule since 1929 was Otto Selz, a German philosopher and psychologist who is considered as being a pioneer of the cognitive sciences.
As a result of the merger plans and especially due to his jewish background Selz was discharged on April 6, 1933 following the Badischen Judenerlass administered by NSDAP politician Robert Heinrich Wagner, a waiver designed to ban jewish academics from German universities.
Later, Selz was deported to the concentration camp Auschwitz where he was executed in 1943; of the eleven docents at Mannheim's Handelshochschule that also possessed a jewish background nine shared Selz's fate.
Only two weeks later the whole inventory and staff were transferred from Mannheim to Heidelberg – with this transfer the merging process was completed and the „jews released“ Handelshochschule Mannheim finally closed.
While the institutes, collections and personnel had been transferred in 1933 the entire absorption process took until April 1938.
 The Mannheim Palace before 1914Although the "Handelshochschule" was closed down in 1933, it built the foundation for what is today known as University of Mannheim.
In World War II, Mannheim was heavily bombed from December 1940 until the end of the war and saw more than 150 air raids.
In 1944, raids bombed and widely devastated the Mannheim Palace, leaving only one room undamaged out of over 500 – only its external walls survived.
Many people supported demolishing it entirely after the war to create additional space for a more modern city architecture.
In 1946, the "Handelshochschule" re-opened under its new name Staatliche Wirtschaftshochschule Mannheim (State College for Economics) with a student body of 545 students in the school's first year.
University of Mannheim's official seal has its origins during the time of the re-opening of the Handelshochschule.
The official seal of the Trustees of the Staatliche "Wirtschaftshochschule" served as the signature and symbol of authenticity on documents issued by the corporation.
A request for one was first recorded in a meeting of the trustees in 1946 during which some of the Trustees desired to get a Common Seal for the Use of the Corporation.
UMA's motto was based on a line in the constitution from Carl Theodor's Palatine Academy of the Sciences Mannheim from 1763, In Omnibus Veritas Suprema Lex Esto that could be translated into "Truth in everything should be the supreme law".
Ten years after its reopening, the "Staatliche Wirtschafshochschule" finally moved into the east wing of the meanwhile rebuilt palace.
The other rooms of the old Residence were occupied by government officials whose offices were still in ruins after the war.
In 1963, the "Staatliche Wirtschafshochschule Mannheim" extended its subject program faculties to a total of three – Business Administration and Social Sciences, Philosophy-Philological Sciences and Law – and subsequently gained the status as "university" on July, 4 in 1967.
The University of Mannheim as it appears todayFollowing the new status the council of ministers of the federal state of Baden-Württemberg decided to rename the State College into the "University of Mannheim" (Universität Mannheim).
While there were only 3,150 students registered in 1967, the number of students tripled by the time of the mid-nineties counting more than 10,000 students.
In the winter term of 2013, the university's student body has reached its all-time high with more than 12,000 students.
During the growth phase of the University in the 1960s and 1970s not only the number of students but also the number of faculties increased.
In 1969, the University of Mannheim expanded its faculty number to eight by adding the faculties of Economics, Geography and Political Sciences and by splitting the faculties of Business Administration and Social Sciences as well as Philosophy-Philological Sciences.
21st century[edit]The emphasis at the University of Mannheim has always remained on business and economics, although teaching was broadened to further disciplines.
In 2000, the university received as first German and third university in Europe the accreditation by Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business for its business administration faculty.
In the same year Mannheim initiated the Renaissance des Barockschlosses (Renaissance of the Mannheim Palace), a funding campaign aimed at raising funds for renovating and extending the main-campus.
In recent years, a policy referred to as "profile sharpening" (Profilschärfung) has been introduced to lift the University's reputation in its research clusters to a European level.
The closing of majors such as geography (2002) and philosophy (2004) in the study program, due to this development back to the roots, has led to frequent complaints from the student council.
As one of the final steps in this transformation, the University of Mannheim has founded the Mannheim Business School (MBS) in 2005 to offer executive education in Germany.
As a result of the transformation process the organizational structure was restructured and the number of faculties was decreased to six.
In 2008, the University passed a reformation statute to increase its cross-faculty collaboration and research and announced its profile as university with a strong focus on Economics, Business Administration, Social Sciences, Law, Mathematics, Computer Science and Humanities.
" — Johann Wolfgang von Goethe The University of Mannheim is located on an urban campus in the city of Mannheim.
Mannheim is a city in southwestern part of Germany and with approximately 315,000 inhabitants, the second-largest city in the state Baden-Württemberg, directly after Stuttgart.
4 million people living there, comprising the neighboring cities of Mannheim, Ludwigshafen and Heidelberg, and a number of smaller towns in the perimeter.
Mannheim is located at the confluence of the Rhine and the Neckar in the northwestern corner of Baden-Württemberg.
The Rhine separates Mannheim from the city of Ludwigshafen, just to the west of it in Rhineland-Palatinate, and the border of Baden-Württemberg with Hesse is just to the north.
Mannheim is unusual among German cities in that its streets and avenues are laid out in a grid pattern, leading to its nickname die Quadratestadt ("city of the squares").
Mannheim is about 30 minutes by train away from Frankfurt am Main and the Frankfurt International Airport, 40 minutes from Karlsruhe and its Baden Airpark as well as one hour by train from Stuttgart and the Stuttgart Airport.
Mannheim is well connected to Berlin and Hamburg, which can be reached within one hour by plane from Mannheim City Airport.
Mannheim's city centers on the eighteenth century Mannheim Palace, the former home of the Prince-elector of the Palatinate, that now houses the University of Mannheim.
Mannheim Palace[edit]The University of Mannheim belongs to the small group of universities in Germany that are said to maintain a classical university campus, widely comparable to those of universities in the United States and the United Kingdom.
All faculties, research institutes and facilities are placed in very short distances to one another and are reachable by feet.
79 km²) in a contiguous area of Mannheim's downtown district; the older heart of the campus and core building comprises the Mannheim Palace.
Although the construction was not completed before 1760, it was used by first administrative institutions since 1725.
Nevertheless, these plans were abolished and in recent years, the palace has been renovated extensively thanks to private donations and government funding totaling more than Euro 54 million.
Several of the University's buildings, mainly the Palace itself, were constructed in the Baroque architecture style from 1650 to the end of the 18th century.
Much of the campus, predominantly the Mannheim Palace was designed by Louis Remy de la Fosse and Johann Kaspar Herwarthel, a prominent architects and the chief court designer of Charles III Philip.
The site of the palace is impressive, although the construction of roads and railway tracks has diminished its dominating appearance.
To the northeast the University's main campus, the palace, presents its 450 m long front to the Mannheim city centre.
Mannheim's main campus – the Palace in a 180 degrees panoramic viewThe central part of the palace represents the Mittelbau which incorporated the representative halls of the Prince-Elector.
The Mittelbau is flanked by the Ehrenhof West and Ehrenhof Ost wings, which include the large Ehrenhof central yard in front of the Mittelbau.
The Northern wing of the Palace includes the impressive Schlosskirche (Palace Church) and houses the Department of Law as well as Mannheim's Amtsgericht (Lower District Court).
Two sculptures are located on the central courtyard and represent the two founders of the Mannheim Palace Charles III Philip, Elector Palatine and Charles Theodore, Elector of Bavaria.
Over the next two years until 2017, a new study and conference center will be built in the west wing of the courtyard.
The study and conference center will feature two semicircular lecture halls, an additional flexible-use conference area, ten breakout rooms and a large foyer that faces the palace garden at the back of the west wing with a large glass façade.
A5 + B6 Campus[edit]Besides the palace the university maintains several building in direct or close distance to the main campus.
They either have new buildings, like the Department of Economics and the Institute of Computer Science, or, like the Faculty of Social Sciences, are housed in renovated buildings.
In 2012, the university and the state Baden-Württemberg has decided to provide the university with several new buildings located in the city quadrates of A5 and B6, which will create a second smaller campus in close neighborhood of the Mannheim palace.
The building complex will house parts of the Mannheim Graduate School GESS, economic research facilities and additional lecture halls.
In addition, the Communication & Fundraising Department is also part of the rectorate and represents the interface between the University and the public.
Another 18 senators are elected for four-year terms, within the following quotas: nine university professors; three academic staff; three delegates of the student body; and three employees of the university administration.
The University Council is the advisory board to the aforementioned entities and encompasses, among others, the director of the Max Planck Institute Martin Hellwig, as well as CEOs of German industries.

Currently, the University of Mannheim has five official faculties and two academic graduate colleges: The Mannheim Business School (MBS) and Graduate School for Economics and Social Sciences (GESS).
At the Mannheim Palace campus, the faculty for business administration, which dates back to the 1969, is the largest faculty with about 4,000 students enrolled, 37 professors, 150 additional academic staff and 37 chairs.
The University comprises five schools: the Business School, the School of Law and Economics, the School of Social Sciences, the School of Humanities and the School of Mathematics and Computer Science.
All the schools are closely interconnected in order to foster an academic and scientific exchange between the different subjects.
The Allgemeiner Studierendenausschuss of the University of Mannheim (AStA) is the student government for University of Mannheim students and all registered students are members.
Its elected leadership consists of the Senate elected by both undergraduate, graduate and postgraduate students, and the President and Vice President elected as a ticket by the entire student body.
As the first German institution, the Business School of the University of Mannheim has gained the "Triple Crown" (Triple accreditation): It is accredited by AACSB International, the Association of MBAs (AMBA) and EFMD (EQUIS).
Rectorate's yard in the front of the Business SchoolThe undergraduate business degree has the most developed integrated international exchange program in Germany, with a mandatory exchange term during the third year and more than 95% of third-year class students participating.
Students generally study for one semester abroad at one of more than 400 highly respected partner schools in more than 50 countries, for instance: McGill University, HEC Paris, University of Hong Kong, National University of Singapore, and University of Miami.
Instead of the exchange term, the program exceptionally allows students to have a further semester at Mannheim with a special curriculum focusing on international course load and business ethics.
At graduate level the "Mannheim Master of Management (MMM)" offers an entirely open course curriculum that allows students to choose courses according to their own wishes.
The range of available courses include all business related subjects and interdisciplinary courses, such Corporate Finance and Banking, Marketing, Entrepreneurship, Strategic Management, Operations Research or Information Systems, and many more.

Libraries[edit]  Entrance to the former Palace LibraryMannheim's library system's origins date back to the early 20th century.
When Mannheim's City College of Trade (Städtische Handelshochschule) was founded in 1907, it maintained a large central library, which was supplemented by various departmental libraries.
In 1932 these libraries were merged with the Municipal Palace Library (Städtische Schlossbücherei), which later became the Municipal Science Library Mannheim (Wissenschaftliche Stadtbibliothek Mannheim).
When the National Socialists came to power in 1933, the College of Trade was dissolved and the books in its library were donated to the University of Heidelberg.
In 1946 the bulk of the collection was returned when the "Staatliche Wirtschaftshochschule Mannheim" (State College of Business Mannheim) was founded.
When the business college became a university in 1967, the library acquired new and much expanded collections in all the subjects taught at the university.
It also inherited around 240,000 volumes of older books from the "Wissenschaftliche Stadtbibliothek Mannheim" (Scientific Municipal Library Mannheim), which was dissolved in 1970.
The conventional book supply is complemented by numerous electronic services, such as 30,000 scientific journals, 600 scientific databases and more than 47,000 e-books that can be accessed via e-journal.
It is one of Germany's most frequently used library systems and in the German library rankings of 2012, it was placed among the 5 best libraries in Germany.
The Schloss Ehrenhof library, also known as "Hasso Plattner" library, is located on the Mannheim Palace campus and is the main library of the university.
The library's construction was primarily funded by a donation of Euro 10 million by the SAP co-founder Hasso Plattner in 2005.
Today, on an area of more than 4,700 square meters, the library houses subject-related literature in economics, history, geography and law.
Besides the Hasso Plattner library, there are the business-focused Schloss Schneckenhof library, the humanities-focused A3 library and the A5 library which has a focus on social sciences, mathematics, computer science and information systems.
Research[edit]  Mannheim Centre for European Social Research (MZES)The profile of the University of Mannheim is reflected in its research achievements.
In economic and social sciences, Mannheim is one of the best research centers in Germany and among the top ten to twenty institutions in Europe.
All disciplines work in close cooperation with each other to determine central research subjects, for example on the topics of decisions, governance, migration and integration or language acquisition.
In close collaboration with the School of Social Sciences, it dedicates its research to exploring societal, social and political development in Europe.
Furthermore, there are different collaborative research centres, such as SFB 884: "Political Economy of Reforms", which aims to provide scientific insights into success and failure of reforms, determined by competing interests, contexts and the political process of reform-making.
The project Group „Contextualized Decision Making: Investigating Mediators and Moderators", funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG), investigates how people make decisions and why decisions often depend on weeny aspects of the situation in which they are taken.
There are also a further three renowned research institutes with close ties to the University: The ZEW — Centre for European Economic Research, GESIS – Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences, and the IDS – Institute of German Language.

Student life[edit]  UMA students revising on Mannheim's CampuswieseMannheim hosts more than 15 Studentenverbindungen (student cooperations), which were predominantly founded in the 19th century.
As traditional symbols (couleurs) corporation members wear colored caps and ribbons at ceremonial occasions (Kommers) and some of them still practice the tradition of academic fencing (Mensur), a kind of duelling, with the intention to "shape their members for the challenges of life.
"  In the 19th and early 20th century, the Studentenverbindungen played an important role in Germany's student life.
Today, however, these corporations include only a relatively small number of students that often have the self-declared mission to keep academic traditions alive and to create friendships for life.

In 2012, the student initiative Mannheim Forum was founded by the three largest student initiatives at Mannheim's campus: Arbeitskreis Börse (AKB), MTP - The Marketing Initiative, and PoliMotion - The Politics Initiative.
The idea and goal behind the initiative was to establish an event that enable participants and students of different branches of study to engage in dynamic dialog with representatives of politics, science and economics about specific issues that are relevant in today's world.
The first event organized by the initiative was the panel discussion in 2012 between Mannheim professors of different disciplines and company representatives about the topic "EU - Economic Poliy - Quo Vadis?!".
From then on, the students' aim was to establish this event on a larger scale under the name "Mannheim Forum" as a fixed annual event at the University of Mannheim.
The first Mannheim Forum was then conducted in 2013 under the topic of “Resources – 6 Perspectives: Economy, Ethics, Security, Politics, Technology and Startups”, followed by the Mannheim Forum in 2014 centering on the topic "Distribution of Power in the World".
Mannheim Forum is mainly organized by students in their first and second academic term (nevertheless it is open to every student at UMA) bringing in new ideas and fresh perspectives, but are supported and financed by external partners, including McKinsey & Co.

The city of Mannheim, founded in 1606, was fortified and at the present site of the Mannheim Palace a fortress called Friedrichsburg was located, sometimes serving as alternative residence for the Elector, one of the most important territorial princes of the Holy Roman Empire.
had confessional controversies with the inhabitants of his capital city Heidelberg, he decided to appoint Mannheim the Palatinate's new capital in year 1720.
The overall building process was intended to cost about 300,000 Gulden, financed by an extraordinary "palace tax" (Schlossbausteuer), but in the end, the palace cost totalled more than 2,000,000 Gulden and severely worsened the Palatinate's financial situation.
Charles Theodore, Count Palatine of Sulzbach and Founder of the "Theodoro-Palatinae" as painted by Johann Georg ZiesenisThe final construction was not completed until 1760.
Karl Philip died in 1742 and was succeeded by a distant relative, the young Count Palatine of Sulzbach and later Duke of Bavaria Charles Theodor.
Under the initiative of the Alsacian scholar Johann Daniel Schöpflin and following the general acadamization movement in Europe, Prince Charles Theodor established the Palatine Academy of the Sciences Mannheim (Kurpfälzische Akademie der Wissenschaften) on October 17, 1763.
The so-called Academia Electoralis Scientiarum et Elegantiorum Literarum Theodoro-Palatinae, shortened "Theodoro Palatinae" concentrated on the teaching of Natural Sciences and History, and soon earned itself a reputation which reached far beyond the borders of Charles Theodor's realm.
In 1778, a second school was established at Mannheim's palace – the Commercial School (Großherzogliche Handelsschule) – that served as school for merchant sons and which was later named into "Grand-Ducal Commercial Academy".
Further associated institutions included the Mannheim Observatory, the Ducal Natural History Collection, the Ducal Physical Cabinet, the Mannheim Palace Botanical Garden and the in 1769 founded Mannheim Academy of Fine Arts.
The establishment of the Theodoro-Palatinae had a strong cultural and educational policy link and intended to foster the sciences and arts in the Palatinate.
Under Charles Theodor's reign the academy received enormous funding of more than 35,000,000 Gulden and contributed considerably to the cultural, economical and infrastructural development of Southern Germany during the second half of the eighteenth century.
The glamour of the Elector's court and Mannheim's then famous cultural life lasted until 1778 when Charles Theodor became Elector of Bavaria by inheritance and moved his court to Munich.
During Napoleon's reorganization of Germany, the Electorate of the Palatinate was split up and Mannheim became part of the Grand Duchy of Electorate-Bavaria, thus losing its capital/residence status.
Although Mannheim kept the title of "residence", the Mannheim Palace was used merely as accommodation for several administrative bodies.
In addition, the reorganization of the Palatinate and Bavaria made the Bavarian Academy of Sciences and Humanities a major concurrent for academic funding.
The consequences of religious strife, increased rivalry for funding and the Napoleonic Wars put an end to the "Theodoro-Palatinae", which was finally closed on February 17, 1803 after forty years of existence.
20th century[edit] Otto Beck - Senior mayor of Mannheim (1891-1908) and one of the Founding Fathers of the Handelshochschule MannheimFor most of the 19th and early 20th centuries, the palace served no uniform purpose, being used as a representative building and a museum for the city.
Although there was no continuous existence of a scientific college in Mannheim, the newly established Handelshochschule Mannheim, or Municipal Commercial College Mannheim, founded in 1907, saw itself in the tradition of Carl Theodor's earlier colleges.
The Handelshochschule was founded under an initiative from Mannheim's senior mayor Otto Beck (1846–1908) and the Heidelberg's economics professor Eberhard Gothein (1853–1923).
This situation changed in mid-1933 when the social democratic municipal administration of Heidelberg and Mannheim was banished and replaced by a national socialistic one that pushed the merging process forward.
Otto Selz - Last Director of the Handelshochschule Mannheim before its closureDirector of the Handelshochschule since 1929 was Otto Selz, a German philosopher and psychologist who is considered as being a pioneer of the cognitive sciences.
As a result of the merger plans and especially due to his jewish background Selz was discharged on April 6, 1933 following the Badischen Judenerlass administered by NSDAP politician Robert Heinrich Wagner, a waiver designed to ban jewish academics from German universities.
Later, Selz was deported to the concentration camp Auschwitz where he was executed in 1943; of the eleven docents at Mannheim's Handelshochschule that also possessed a jewish background nine shared Selz's fate.
Only two weeks later the whole inventory and staff were transferred from Mannheim to Heidelberg – with this transfer the merging process was completed and the „jews released“ Handelshochschule Mannheim finally closed.
While the institutes, collections and personnel had been transferred in 1933 the entire absorption process took until April 1938.
 The Mannheim Palace before 1914Although the "Handelshochschule" was closed down in 1933, it built the foundation for what is today known as University of Mannheim.
In World War II, Mannheim was heavily bombed from December 1940 until the end of the war and saw more than 150 air raids.
In 1944, raids bombed and widely devastated the Mannheim Palace, leaving only one room undamaged out of over 500 – only its external walls survived.
Many people supported demolishing it entirely after the war to create additional space for a more modern city architecture.
In 1946, the "Handelshochschule" re-opened under its new name Staatliche Wirtschaftshochschule Mannheim (State College for Economics) with a student body of 545 students in the school's first year.
University of Mannheim's official seal has its origins during the time of the re-opening of the Handelshochschule.
The official seal of the Trustees of the Staatliche "Wirtschaftshochschule" served as the signature and symbol of authenticity on documents issued by the corporation.
A request for one was first recorded in a meeting of the trustees in 1946 during which some of the Trustees desired to get a Common Seal for the Use of the Corporation.
UMA's motto was based on a line in the constitution from Carl Theodor's Palatine Academy of the Sciences Mannheim from 1763, In Omnibus Veritas Suprema Lex Esto that could be translated into "Truth in everything should be the supreme law".
Ten years after its reopening, the "Staatliche Wirtschafshochschule" finally moved into the east wing of the meanwhile rebuilt palace.
The other rooms of the old Residence were occupied by government officials whose offices were still in ruins after the war.
In 1963, the "Staatliche Wirtschafshochschule Mannheim" extended its subject program faculties to a total of three – Business Administration and Social Sciences, Philosophy-Philological Sciences and Law – and subsequently gained the status as "university" on July, 4 in 1967.
The University of Mannheim as it appears todayFollowing the new status the council of ministers of the federal state of Baden-Württemberg decided to rename the State College into the "University of Mannheim" (Universität Mannheim).
While there were only 3,150 students registered in 1967, the number of students tripled by the time of the mid-nineties counting more than 10,000 students.
In the winter term of 2013, the university's student body has reached its all-time high with more than 12,000 students.
During the growth phase of the University in the 1960s and 1970s not only the number of students but also the number of faculties increased.
In 1969, the University of Mannheim expanded its faculty number to eight by adding the faculties of Economics, Geography and Political Sciences and by splitting the faculties of Business Administration and Social Sciences as well as Philosophy-Philological Sciences.
21st century[edit]The emphasis at the University of Mannheim has always remained on business and economics, although teaching was broadened to further disciplines.
In 2000, the university received as first German and third university in Europe the accreditation by Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business for its business administration faculty.
In the same year Mannheim initiated the Renaissance des Barockschlosses (Renaissance of the Mannheim Palace), a funding campaign aimed at raising funds for renovating and extending the main-campus.
In recent years, a policy referred to as "profile sharpening" (Profilschärfung) has been introduced to lift the University's reputation in its research clusters to a European level.
The closing of majors such as geography (2002) and philosophy (2004) in the study program, due to this development back to the roots, has led to frequent complaints from the student council.
As one of the final steps in this transformation, the University of Mannheim has founded the Mannheim Business School (MBS) in 2005 to offer executive education in Germany.
As a result of the transformation process the organizational structure was restructured and the number of faculties was decreased to six.
In 2008, the University passed a reformation statute to increase its cross-faculty collaboration and research and announced its profile as university with a strong focus on Economics, Business Administration, Social Sciences, Law, Mathematics, Computer Science and Humanities.
" — Johann Wolfgang von Goethe The University of Mannheim is located on an urban campus in the city of Mannheim.
Mannheim is a city in southwestern part of Germany and with approximately 315,000 inhabitants, the second-largest city in the state Baden-Württemberg, directly after Stuttgart.
4 million people living there, comprising the neighboring cities of Mannheim, Ludwigshafen and Heidelberg, and a number of smaller towns in the perimeter.
Mannheim is located at the confluence of the Rhine and the Neckar in the northwestern corner of Baden-Württemberg.
The Rhine separates Mannheim from the city of Ludwigshafen, just to the west of it in Rhineland-Palatinate, and the border of Baden-Württemberg with Hesse is just to the north.
Mannheim is unusual among German cities in that its streets and avenues are laid out in a grid pattern, leading to its nickname die Quadratestadt ("city of the squares").
Mannheim is about 30 minutes by train away from Frankfurt am Main and the Frankfurt International Airport, 40 minutes from Karlsruhe and its Baden Airpark as well as one hour by train from Stuttgart and the Stuttgart Airport.
Mannheim is well connected to Berlin and Hamburg, which can be reached within one hour by plane from Mannheim City Airport.
Mannheim's city centers on the eighteenth century Mannheim Palace, the former home of the Prince-elector of the Palatinate, that now houses the University of Mannheim.
Mannheim Palace[edit]The University of Mannheim belongs to the small group of universities in Germany that are said to maintain a classical university campus, widely comparable to those of universities in the United States and the United Kingdom.
All faculties, research institutes and facilities are placed in very short distances to one another and are reachable by feet.
79 km²) in a contiguous area of Mannheim's downtown district; the older heart of the campus and core building comprises the Mannheim Palace.
Although the construction was not completed before 1760, it was used by first administrative institutions since 1725.
Nevertheless, these plans were abolished and in recent years, the palace has been renovated extensively thanks to private donations and government funding totaling more than Euro 54 million.
Several of the University's buildings, mainly the Palace itself, were constructed in the Baroque architecture style from 1650 to the end of the 18th century.
Much of the campus, predominantly the Mannheim Palace was designed by Louis Remy de la Fosse and Johann Kaspar Herwarthel, a prominent architects and the chief court designer of Charles III Philip.
The site of the palace is impressive, although the construction of roads and railway tracks has diminished its dominating appearance.
To the northeast the University's main campus, the palace, presents its 450 m long front to the Mannheim city centre.
Mannheim's main campus – the Palace in a 180 degrees panoramic viewThe central part of the palace represents the Mittelbau which incorporated the representative halls of the Prince-Elector.
The Mittelbau is flanked by the Ehrenhof West and Ehrenhof Ost wings, which include the large Ehrenhof central yard in front of the Mittelbau.
The Northern wing of the Palace includes the impressive Schlosskirche (Palace Church) and houses the Department of Law as well as Mannheim's Amtsgericht (Lower District Court).
Two sculptures are located on the central courtyard and represent the two founders of the Mannheim Palace Charles III Philip, Elector Palatine and Charles Theodore, Elector of Bavaria.
Over the next two years until 2017, a new study and conference center will be built in the west wing of the courtyard.
The study and conference center will feature two semicircular lecture halls, an additional flexible-use conference area, ten breakout rooms and a large foyer that faces the palace garden at the back of the west wing with a large glass façade.
A5 + B6 Campus[edit]Besides the palace the university maintains several building in direct or close distance to the main campus.
They either have new buildings, like the Department of Economics and the Institute of Computer Science, or, like the Faculty of Social Sciences, are housed in renovated buildings.
In 2012, the university and the state Baden-Württemberg has decided to provide the university with several new buildings located in the city quadrates of A5 and B6, which will create a second smaller campus in close neighborhood of the Mannheim palace.
The building complex will house parts of the Mannheim Graduate School GESS, economic research facilities and additional lecture halls.
In addition, the Communication & Fundraising Department is also part of the rectorate and represents the interface between the University and the public.

Since 1993, the club has been reinforcing the alumni's lifelong bonds with the University of Mannheim, as well as the networks among its members, by means of numerous events and information platforms.
Besides topical speeches by renowned people, the participants also have the opportunity to attend the Recruiting Fair, as well as participate in several company workshops.
During the panel discussions the audience can discuss with several top tier personalities from the worlds of business, economics, society and politics.
Germany), Peer Steinbrück, Paul Achleitner, Christian Lindner, Götz Werner, Dirk Müller (famous broker, known as "Mister Dax"), Hamed Abdel-Samad, Sahra Wagenknecht and Frank Plasberg etc.
Under the topic „Time Questions: Politics, Economy, Society and Science“, the most recent Forum took place, under the patronage of the state Baden-Württemberg and its Minister-President Winfried Kretschmann, from 13th until 15 March 2015 on Mannheim's main campus - the Mannheim Palace.
In 2012, the student initiative Mannheim Forum was founded by the three largest student initiatives at Mannheim's campus: Arbeitskreis Börse (AKB), MTP - The Marketing Initiative, and PoliMotion - The Politics Initiative.
The idea and goal behind the initiative was to establish an event that enable participants and students of different branches of study to engage in dynamic dialog with representatives of politics, science and economics about specific issues that are relevant in today's world.
The first event organized by the initiative was the panel discussion in 2012 between Mannheim professors of different disciplines and company representatives about the topic "EU - Economic Poliy - Quo Vadis?!".
From then on, the students' aim was to establish this event on a larger scale under the name "Mannheim Forum" as a fixed annual event at the University of Mannheim.
The first Mannheim Forum was then conducted in 2013 under the topic of “Resources – 6 Perspectives: Economy, Ethics, Security, Politics, Technology and Startups”, followed by the Mannheim Forum in 2014 centering on the topic "Distribution of Power in the World".
Mannheim Forum is mainly organized by students in their first and second academic term (nevertheless it is open to every student at UMA) bringing in new ideas and fresh perspectives, but are supported and financed by external partners, including McKinsey & Co.
, SAP AG, Lufthansa, Reckitt Benckiser, HSBC, Deloitte, Heidelberg Cement, Hoffmann-La Roche as well as the Mannheim Business School and alumni - who ensure that knowledge based on experience is used and implemented.
Furthermore, the Mannheim Forum holds close cooperations with other student initiatives at the University of Mannheim, like MTP, Arbeitskreis Börse and POLImotion.
Traditions[edit]  The Arena of Pop in 2007 on University of Mannheim's EhrenhofEach year the University of Mannheim is host of the Schlossfest (Palace Festival), a festival at which the Mannheim Palace campus is open to visitors and introduces the university to incoming freshmen.
The science events include live experiments and academic speeches regarding specific subjects, while the arts events include art exhibitions, art workshops, dance acts, museum guides as well as guides through the old, non-public areas within the Mannheim Palace.
Furthermore, several live-acts including musicians like Xavier Naidoo (2011), Söhne Mannheims, orchestras as well as comedians like Bülent Ceylan (2009) are part of the event program.
The University of Mannheim also regularly hosts a large number of concerts, sport events, talks as well as theatrical performances.
One of the largest events represents the annual music concert Arena of Pop organized by the radio station BigFM that featured acts including P!nk, Ricky Martin, Foreigner or Sunrise Avenue.
Of those parties the most famous are the ones hosted by the Fachschaft BWL (Student Council of Business Administration) once each academic term, called "BWLer Fete", which normally attract the largest number of visitors, e.
The BWLer Fete is traditionally sponsored by different corporate partners such as Hays, Oliver Wyman or MLP and each party is organized under a unique theme, such as Russian Lover (Fall 2010), Circus Circus (Summer 2010), Like A Boss (Fall 2012) or Schneckenhof Goes Hollywood (Fall 2013).
Each of the "BWLer Fete" parties usually ends with the refrain of the song "Meine Stadt" by the Söhne Mannheims.

The Ruhr-University Bochum is one of the largest universities in Germany and part of the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, the most important German research funding organization.
The RUB was very successful in the Excellence Initiative of the German Federal and State Governments (2007), a competition between Germany's most prestigious universities.
It was one of the few institutions left competing for the title of an "elite university", but did not succeed in the last round of the competition.
The University of Bochum was one of the first universities in Germany to introduce international bachelor's and master's degrees, which replaced the traditional German Diplom and Magister.
Except for a few special cases (for example in Law) these degrees are offered by all faculties of the Ruhr-University.
Currently, the university offers a total of 184 different study programs from all academic fields represented at the university.
Contents  [hide] 1 Organization2 Facility3 Points of interest4 See also5 References6 External linksOrganization[edit]Ruhr-University is financed and administered by the state of North Rhine-Westphalia.
Currently, 42,718 students are enrolled, and the university employs around 5,600 staff (411 of which are professors), making it one of the ten largest universities in Germany (as of 2014).
Kurt Biedenkopf, who later became prime minister of the state of Saxony, was director of the university from 1967 to 1969.
The Faculty of Medicine includes several university clinics which are located at different centres in Bochum and the Ruhr area.
A major facility for patient care is the University Hospital/Knappschaftskrankenhaus in the Langendreer part of Bochum.
Internationally renowned experts in their respective fields are professors Wolff Schmiegel in oncology and Burkhard Dick in ophthalmology.
The centralized university campus architecture is comprised almost exclusively of the 1960s architecture style referred to as Brutalism, consisting of 14 almost identical high-rise buildings.
The arrangement of the buildings and the (concrete) paths and bridges between them was originally meant to resemble a "harbour of knowledge", with the buildings simbolising vessels, by architect Helmut Hentrich[de].
The campus undergoes heavy modernisation and extension efforts, including the construction and refurbishment of several buildings.
The overall campus concept envisions a modern facility and the placement of Bochum as a "knowledge city".

About 14% of its students come from foreign countries, a larger percentage than at comparable German universities.
It is one of the new, modern universities in Bavaria, and with approximately 18,000 (Oct 2012) students it is still of a manageable size.
About 20% of the German students come from outside Bavaria, and at 14% its share of foreign students is larger than at comparable universities.
The University of Augsburg maintains partnerships with the Universities of Pittsburgh (USA), Osijek (Croatia) and Iaşi (Romania), and the Far Eastern State University of Humanities, which is in Khabarovsk (Russia).
It has cooperation agreements with over forty universities in Europe, Asia, South Africa, North America and Latin America.
Anyone who has studied or carried out research here can keep in touch with the University of Augsburg once they have returned home.
University library[edit]Augsburg University library consists of the central library plus libraries for social sciences, humanities and natural sciences.
Professional language teaching[edit]The University of Augsburg's Language Centre provides tuition in modern languages.
In addition to this, the Language Centre offers courses specifically tailored to law and economics students, as well as the opportunity to study other languages such as Russian, Turkish or Japanese.
The University of Augsburg and the University of Applied Sciences work closely together in a joint testing centre for German as a Foreign Language (“TestDaF-Zentrum”), which tests the German language skills of international students.
Partnerships[edit]The University of Augsburg has cooperation agreements with over 40 universities in Europe, Asia, South Africa, North America and Latin America.
November 2009 over 500 students occupied the lecture room number 1 to call attention to the bad conditions in Augsburg and the entire German educational system.
Specifically, they protested against the need for university students to pay tuition fees and what they perceived as a decline in education quality in the German high school system.
December, using it as a plenary meeting room, holding discussions, organizing theatre and concert performances, showing films, and presenting their claims to the university administration and the Bavarian state.
They agreed to end the sit-in because the university vice-president gave assurances that he would solve the problems, which are part of the university itself.
Eventually, all German states scrapped the experiment with university tuition fees in public universities, after mass student protests.

The University is part of the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, a society of Germany's leading research universities.
2 Architecture5 Notable Alumni and Professors6 References7 External linksHistory[edit]Siegen’s heritage as a centre for education and research dates back to the 16th century.
In 1536, William I, Count of Nassau-Dillenburg charged Saxon educator and theologian Erasmus Sarcerius with the task of establishing a Latin school.
During the period 1594 to 1599/1600 and 1606 to 1609, the Calvinist-Reformed Herborn Academy (Academia Nassauensis) moved from Herborn to Siegen, where it was accommodated in the buildings of the lower castle.
Siegen Wiesenbauschule landscaping school around 1903”Wiesenbauschule“[edit]In 1853, Wiesenbauschule landscaping school was established, which soon gained a reputation outside of its local area.
Here, landscaping and land improvements including irrigation techniques and the drainage of meadows were taught, so as to help enhance the yields from farmland.
This was of particular importance in the Siegerland region because the high demand for charcoal for the regional ironworks meant that most areas were woodland.
As a result, limited areas were suitable for cattle breeding, so that research into enhancing the yields from the limited amount of meadowland had to be researched.
Following World War Two, the school’s focus shifted towards civil engineering, and, in 1962, it was renamed Staatliche Ingenieurschule für Bauwesen (State School of Civil Engineering).
Precursor and foundation[edit]The next academic facility to be set up in Siegen (formerly located at Weidenau/Hüttental) was the Pädagogische Hochschule Siegerland (Educational University Siegerland), established in 1964.
In 1965, it became the Siegerland section of Pädagogische Hochschule Westfalen-Lippe (Educational University Westfalen-Lippe), which marked its transformation into a scientific university.
On 1 August 1972, the comprehensive university development act led to the setting up of a comprehensive university at Siegen/Hüttental, along with four other comprehensive universities in North Rhine-Westphalia.
The Pädagogische Hochschule Siegerland and Siegen-Gummersbach University of Applied Sciences which had schools based at Siegen and Gummersbach merged to form the new Siegen comprehensive university.
In 1980, Siegen comprehensive university was renamed Universität-Gesamthochschule (University-Comprehensive University).
Then, on 1 January 2003, the form of ”comprehensive university“ was abandoned, and the existing comprehensive universities became regular universities.
University of Siegen sees itself as a modern university with a focus on basic research, practical training and contributing towards structural change in the district of Siegen-Wittgenstein and adjacent regions.
In line with the political objectives which led to the establishment of comprehensive universities, the University of Siegen is a hallmark for democracy, equal opportunities, transparent professional and scientific education as well as an international outlook.
The reform approach inherent to the comprehensive university was put into practice through integral programmes, such as the innovative integrated diploma programmes “Media planning, development and consultancy” and “German and European commercial law”.
Within the framework of the Bologna process, the University of Siegen implemented the Bachelor/Masters system early on, with the aim of completing the set-up of this model in all faculties during winter semester 2006–2007.
The last remaining diploma programmes were actually transformed into Bachelor/Masters programmes during winter semester 2008–2009.
This move enables students’ achievements to be comparable and drives the international orientation of programmes.
The University of Siegen is increasingly committed to working with alumni and organizes alumni meetings at regular intervals.
The University of Siegen offers a large variety of undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral degree programs at its four faculties in 144 fields of study.
However, lectures and classes usually do not run for the full duration of these periods and allow for breaks in spring and fall.
German universities enjoy government subsidies, and as a result of legislative reform, beginning in Fall 2011 the University of Siegen will no longer charge tuition fees.
Student Life[edit]There are numerous student clubs and organizations, among them a student-run radio station, Radius 92.
Siegen is situated in one of the most densely forested areas in Germany and offers fine opportunities for leisure and outdoor activities.
Additionally, there are further dormitories in Siegen which are operated by other institutions as well as partnerships with elderly people.
International Students[edit]The International Office is the main contact for questions concerning the international course of studies, the international academy cooperation and the international academic exchange.
Additionally the International Office guides and mentors international applicants for a place at university with all kinds of questions around the course of studies and life in Siegen.
A number of activities for international students facilitates their integration and help students to find new friends.
Each semester the International Office offers a Welcome week where international students are guided through their first steps in Siegen (walk through the city, opening a bank account, registration for medical insurance etc.
During the semester a program including trips to nearby cities, intercultural trainings or high rope courses is offered.

In 1949, it changed its name to Humboldt-Universität in honour of both its founder Wilhelm and his brother, geographer Alexander von Humboldt.
In 2012, the Humboldt University of Berlin was one of eleven German universities to win in the German Universities Excellence Initiative, a national competition for universities organized by the German Federal Government.
The university has educated 29 Nobel Prize winners and is considered one of the prestigious universities in Europe as well as one of the most prestigious universities in the world for arts and humanities.

Artist: Paul OttoThe first semester at the newly founded Berlin university occurred in 1810 with 256 students and 52 lecturers in faculties of law, medicine, theology and philosophy under rector Theodor Schmalz.
The university has been home to many of Germany's greatest thinkers of the past two centuries, among them the subjective idealist philosopher Johann Gottlieb Fichte, the theologian Friedrich Schleiermacher, the absolute idealist philosopher G.
Hegel, the Romantic legal theorist Friedrich Carl von Savigny, the pessimist philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer, the objective idealist philosopher Friedrich Schelling, cultural critic Walter Benjamin, and famous physicists Albert Einstein and Max Planck.

The structure of German research-intensive universities, such as Humboldt, served as a model for institutions like Johns Hopkins University.
] with its central principle being the union of teaching and research in the work of the individual scholar or scientist.
"Enlargement[edit]  Statue of Alexander von Humboldt outside Humboldt University, from 1883 by artist Reinhold Begas.
In addition to the strong anchoring of traditional subjects, such as science, law, philosophy, history, theology and medicine, Berlin University developed to encompass numerous new scientific disciplines.
With the construction of modern research facilities in the second half of the 19th Century teaching of the natural sciences began.
Humboldt University became an emulated model of a modern university in the 19th century (photochrom from 1900).
During this period of enlargement, Berlin University gradually expanded to incorporate other previously separate colleges in Berlin.
In 1717, King Friedrich I had built a quarantine house for Plague at the city gates, which in 1727 was rechristened by the "soldier king" Friedrich Wilhelm: "Es soll das Haus die Charité heißen" (It will be called Charité [French for charity]).
By 1829 the site became Berlin University's medical campus and remained so until 1927 when the more modern University Hospital was constructed.
Berlin University started a natural history collection in 1810, which, by 1889 required a separate building and became the Museum für Naturkunde.
The preexisting Tierarznei School, founded in 1790 and absorbed by the university, in 1934 formed the basis of the Veterinary Medicine Facility (Grundstock der Veterinärmedizinischen Fakultät).
Also the Landwirtschaftliche Hochschule Berlin (Agricultural University of Berlin), founded in 1881 was affiliated with the Agricultural Faculties of the University.
Third Reich[edit]  The University in 1938After 1933, like all German universities, it was affected by the Nazi regime.
It was from the university's library that some 20,000 books by "degenerates" and opponents of the regime were taken to be burned on May 10 of that year in the Opernplatz (now the Bebelplatz) for a demonstration protected by the SA that also featured a speech by Joseph Goebbels.
The Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service (German "Gesetz zur Wiederherstellung des Berufsbeamtentums") resulted in 250 Jewish professors and employees being fired during 1933/1934 and numerous doctorates being withdrawn.
The SMAD wanted a redesigned Berlin University based on the Soviet model, however they insisted on the phrasing "newly opened" and not "re-opened" for political reasons.
The president of the German Central Administration for National Education (DZVV), Paul Wandel, in his address at the January 29, 1946, opening ceremony, said: "I spoke of the opening, and not of the re-opening of the university.
" The teaching was limited to seven departments working in reopened, war-damaged buildings, with many of the teachers dead or missing.
Berlin University, 1950The Workers and Peasants Faculty (German: Arbeiter-und-Bauern-Fakultät) (ABF), an education program aimed at young men who, due to political or racial reasons, had been disadvantaged under the Nazis, was established at the university during this time.
The Soviet Military Tribunal in Berlin-Lichtenberg ruled the students were involved in the formation of a "resistance movement at the University of Berlin", as well as espionage, and were sentenced to 25 years of forced labor.
From 1945 to 1948, 18 other students and teachers were arrested or abducted, many gone for weeks, and some taken to the Soviet Union and executed.
[citation needed]In the spring of 1948, after several university students with admission irregularities were withdrawn, the opposition demanded a "free" university.
Students and scholars, with support from especially the Americans, the newspaper Der Tagesspiegel, and the governing Mayor Ernst Reuter founded the Free University of Berlin in Dahlem (part of the American sector).
The decades-long division of the city into East and West Berlin finally cemented the division into two independent universities permanently.
East Germany[edit]  Humboldt University in 1964Since the old name of the university had some monarchic origins the university was renamed.
Although the Soviets and the government of East Berlin preferred a naming after some communist leader the university was in the end named after the two Humboldt brothers.
Independent research and teaching was not longer possible; instead the academic staff was replaced by communists to get the education system in line with the ruling ideology.
[citation needed] Nevertheless, it was still possible in some areas to restore international contacts and create world-wide cooperation.
The long-standing and intensive research and exchange links with the universities in Eastern Europe and particularly in the former Soviet Union are worth special mentioning; many of these links are without parallel in Germany.
In addition, formal academic cooperation with nearly all universities in the capital cities of Western Europe has existed since the 1970s.
And for several years there have been close relations to universities in Japan and the United States, as well as in Asian, African and Latin American countries.
Its communist-selected students and scholars did not participate to any significant degree in the East German democratic civil rights movements of 1989, and elected the controversial SED member and former Stasi spy Heinrich Fink as the Rector of the university as late as 1990.
[citation needed]Modern Germany[edit]  The main building of Humboldt University, located in Berlin's "Mitte" district (Unter den Linden boulevard)After the unification of East and West Germany, the university was radically restructured and all professors had to reapply for their positions.
The faculty was largely replaced with West German professors, among them the historian Heinrich August Winkler.
Today, Humboldt University is a state university with a large number of students (36,986 in 2014, among them more than 4,662 foreign students) after the model of West German universities, and like its counterpart the Free University of Berlin.
Its main building is located in the centre of Berlin at the boulevard Unter den Linden and is the heart of Campus Mitte.
All the institutes of humanities are located around the main building together with the Department of Law and the Department of Business and Economics.
Campus Nord is located north of the main building close to Berlin Hauptbahnhof and is the home of the life science departments including the university medical center Charité.
The natural science together with computer science and mathematics are located at Campus Adlershof in the south-east of Berlin.
During the Weimar Period the library contained 831,934 volumes (1930) and was thus one of the leading university libraries in Germany at that time.
In 2003, natural science related books were outhoused to the newly founded library at the Adlershof campus, which is dedicated solely to the natural sciences.
Since the premises of the State Library had to be cleared in 2005, a new library building is about to be erected close to the main building in the center of Berlin.
5 million volumes and 9000 held magazines and journals and is one of the biggest university libraries in Germany.
The books of the Institut für Sexualwissenschaft were destroyed during the Nazi book burnings and the institute destroyed.
Under the terms of the Magnus Hirschfeld Foundation, the government had undertaken to continue the work of the institute at the university after its founder's death.
In 2001 however the university acquired the Archive for Sexology from the Robert Koch Institute, which was founded on a large private library donated by Erwin J.
The British Times Higher Education World University Ranking 2016 listed Humboldt-University as the 49th best university in the world and 3rd best in Germany.

The University of Bremen (German Universität Bremen) is one of 11 institutions classed as an "Elite university" in Germany, and a university of approximately 23,500 people from 126 countries[citation needed] that are studying, teaching, researching, and working in Bremen.
The university has a most notable reputation in political science, industrial engineering, digital media, physics, mathematics, microbiology, geosciences (particularly marine geosciences), and European law.
[citation needed]Its commitment was rewarded with the title “Stadt der Wissenschaft 2005” (City of Science of 2005), which science, politics, business and culture won jointly for Bremen and Bremerhaven, by the Foundation for German Science (Stifterverband für die Deutsche Wissenschaft).
Other reform approaches of the former ‘new university’ have proven to be errors such as waiving a mid-level faculty, tripartite representation or too “student-friendly” examination regulations and were given up in Bremen a few years ago.
The development of the University of Bremen can be divided up into steps of 10 to 12 years – first foundation, then restructuring, consolidation and profile building.
At the beginning of the 1970s, the University was set up as a “science complex”in , a city oriented towards trade and seafaring that had no experience with academia, particularly not with leftist professors.
Other important factors were the initial success in setting up collaborative research centres and in the acquisition of considerable of external funds.
The mathematics professor Jürgen Timm, elected university rector in 1982, was largely responsible for this turnaround.
As a consequence, the University of Bremen improved in research rankings, gained national recognition, and established a number of endowment professorships.
Research excellence and its interdisciplinary profile is reflected in the establishment of numerous research centers and programs funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG).
These currently include eight collaborative research centers and the Research Center of Ocean Margins, one of only six national research centers of the DFG.
From 1996 until 2001 the University of Bremen (along with six other universities in Germany) participated in a pilot scheme for structural reform of university administration, funded by the Volkswagen Foundation.
This project improved the co-operation and communication between the university's administration, teaching and research units.
With the realization of the "Laptop University" project, the University of Bremen became a leading university in the field of digital media education in Germany.
In teaching, there are comprehensive evaluations, more specific admission requirements, and improved completion rates for Bachelors and master's degrees.

Contents  [hide] 1 History2 Location3 Departments and Institutes4 See also5 References6 External linksHistory[edit]Higher education began in 1632 in Osnabrück when the Gymnasium Carolinum was upgraded into a Jesuit university.
However, the Academia Carolina Osnabrugensis was closed just one year later when Swedish troops recaptured Osnabrück for the Protestant side in the Thirty Years' War.
The government of the state of Lower Saxony decided to set up a university in Osnabrück in 1970, and by 1973 had laid down the legal basis for such an institution.
The university opened for the summer semester in 1974 as a successor institution to the Adolf Reichwein Teachers' College, which had occupied the former palace of the Prince-Bishopric since 1953.
Location[edit]The main building of Osnabrück University is the baroque castle (built 1667-1675), formerly home and office to the Prince-Bishop of Osnabrück, nowadays housing mainly university administration.
Sport stadium and gymnasium are a bit farther away; the mathematical and natural-scientific faculties as well as the botanical garden are located in the western part of the city in the borough "Westerberg" (the "Western Mountain", which is rather a hill than a mountain).
Departments and Institutes[edit]The University of Osnabrück consists of ten schools (Fachbereiche) and four interdisciplinary institutes.
"Ere long the Jesuits made the Carolinum an important educational stronghold in the cause of the Counter-Reformation and in the middle of the seventeenth century, during the Thirty Years War, the Carolinum was raised to the status of Jesuit University.
A year after its official opening, the university was closed down again, as the city, having the misfortune to be in the frontline between warring Protestants and Catholics, suffered the fate of repeated power changes.

In 1879 the Higher Vocational School moved into the historic Guelph Palace, the Welfenschloss, which was specially converted for the purpose.
Later, the Higher Vocational School became the Royal College of Technology (German: Königliche Technische Hochschule).
In 1899 Kaiser Wilhelm II granted the College of Technology a status equal to that of universities and the right to confer doctorates.
In 1968 the Faculty of Humanities and Political Science were founded and the "College of Technology" became the "Technische Hochschule" ("Technical University").
Between 1973 and 1980 the faculties of Law, Business and Economics, the formerly independent Teachers Training College were added to the University and the "Technical University" was renamed "University of Hannover.
On the 175th anniversary of the institution in 2006, the "University of Hannover" was given the name "Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Universität Hannover.
Namesake[edit] Gottfried Wilhelm LeibnizThe Senate of the University voted in April 2006 to rename the University of Hannover to "Leibniz Universität Hannover".
Following agreement by the Leibniz Academy on the use of the name, the "Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Universität Hannover" received its name on the 360th anniversary of Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz's birth.
The current logo is a stylized excerpt from a letter to Duke Rudolf August of Wolfenbüttel, in which Leibniz presented binary numbers for the first time.
Faculties and staff[edit]Nine faculties with more than 190 first-degree full-time and part-time degree courses make the university the second-largest institution of higher education in Lower Saxony.
It has 1810 additional employees in administrative functions, 90 apprentices and some 1400 staff funded by third parties.
It expanded into an important collection as the institution evolved from a vocational/technical college into the full University.
The removal of the books into storage during the Second World War secured valuable old stocks that became a unique national collection of scientific and technical literature in postwar Germany.
This was the basis on which the library of the Institute of Technology (German: Technische Informationsbibliothek) was established in 1959.
Today the collection forms the heart of the German National Library of Science and Technology, which is the largest institution of its kind in the world.
GISMA School of Business[edit]GISMA Business School in Hannover, Germany, was launched in 1999 as a joint initiative by the state of Lower Saxony and visionary private-sector enterprises.

As one of eleven German Excellence Universities, University of Konstanz is consistently ranked among the global top 250 by the Times Higher Education World University Rankings .
Over 10,000 students from close to 100 countries are enrolled at the university, while over 220 links to European partner universities and numerous exchange programmes facilitate global networking.
Moreover, Konstanz University cooperates with a large number of renowned universities such as Johns Hopkins University, Yale University, the University of Chicago, UC Berkeley and the University of Zurich.
The beginning was makeshift - in the middle of Sonnenbühl on the edge of the town quarter Petershausen on the right side of the Rhine, with only a handful of professors and a few dozen students.
Starting in 1967, today's campus was developed through individual construction projects on the hill known as the Gießberg.
In 2007 the University joined the German Universities Excellence Initiative competition and succeeded in becoming Germany's smallest and youngest University of Excellence.
The University secured funding for its institutional strategy "Towards a Culture of Creativity", the graduate school "Chemical Biology" as well as the cluster of excellence "Cultural Foundations of Integration".
This result was reconfirmed when the university succeeded in the second programme phase (2012-2017) with all projects and additionally was granted the "Graduate School of Decision Sciences".
The university was planned as a place of life and learning, in which new forms of research and teaching should be reflected in the architectural style.
Dense construction, short paths, the absence of large auditoriums in exchange for a large number of seminar rooms, as well as the variety of work, traffic, and quiet areas, are all part of the architectural concept.
In addition, there was the idea of creating lasting "Kunst am Bau" (structural art) accents, so that the building of a desolate concrete landscape could be avoided in an effective manner.

de University of Munich logo Ludwig-Maximilian University of Munich (also referred to as LMU or the University of Munich, in German: Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München) is a public research university located in Munich, Germany.
In 1802, the university was officially named Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität by King Maximilian I of Bavaria in his as well as the university's original founder's honour.
The University of Munich has, particularly since the 19th century, been considered as one of Germany's as well as one of Europe's most prestigious universities; with 34 Nobel laureates associated with the university, it ranks 13th worldwide by number of Nobel laureates.
The LMU has recently been conferred the title of "elite university" under the German Universities Excellence Initiative.
LMU is currently the second-largest university in Germany in terms of student population; in the winter semester of 2013/2014, the university had a total of 50,542 matriculated students.
Of these, 8,719 were freshmen while international students totalled 7,403 or almost 15% of the student population.
3 million Euros in funding without the university hospital; with the university hospital, the university has a total funding amounting to approximately 1.
In the period of German humanism, the university's academics included names such as Conrad Celtes and Petrus Apianus.
From 1549 to 1773, the university was influenced by the Jesuits and became one of the centres of the Counter-Reformation.
At the end of the 18th century, the university was influenced by the Enlightenment, which led to a stronger emphasis on natural science.
In 1802, the university was renamed the Ludwig Maximilian University in honour of its two founders, Louis IX, Duke of Bavaria and Maximilian I, Elector of Bavaria.
The Minister of Education, Maximilian von Montgelas, initiated a number of reforms that sought to modernize the rather conservative and Jesuit-influenced university.
The locals were somewhat critical of the amount of Protestant professors Maximilian and later Ludwig I invited to Munich.
They were dubbed the "Nordlichter" (Northern lights) and especially physician Johann Nepomuk von Ringseis was quite angry about them.
 View of the University of Munich from Amalienstrasse around 1900In the second half of the 19th century, the university rose to great prominence in the European scientific community, attracting many of the world's leading scientists.
From 1903, women were allowed to study at Bavarian universities, and by 1918, the female proportion of students at LMU had reached 18%.
During the Weimar Republic, the university continued to be one of the world's leading universities, with professors such as Wilhelm Röntgen, Wilhelm Wien, Richard Willstätter, Arnold Sommerfeld and Ferdinand Sauerbruch.
1943–1945[edit] Sophie Scholl, an LMU student and core member of the White Rose groupDuring the Third Reich, academic freedom was severely curtailed.
In 1943 the White Rose group of anti-Nazi students conducted their campaign of opposition to the National Socialists at this university.
1945–present[edit]  View of the main building of LMU from Ludwigstrasse in 2009  Colonnade in the first floorThe university has continued to be one of the leading universities of West Germany during the Cold War and in the post-reunification era.
Today the University of Munich is part of 24 Collaborative Research Centers funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG) and is host university of 13 of them.
It also hosts 12 DFG Research Training Groups and three international doctorate programs as part of the Elite Network of Bavaria.
It attracts an additional 120 million euros per year in outside funding and is intensively involved in national and international funding initiatives.
In 2005, Germany’s state and federal governments launched the German Universities Excellence Initiative, a contest among its universities.
9 billion euros, 75 percent of which comes from the federal state, its architects aim to strategically promote top-level research and scholarship.
The initiative will fund three project-oriented areas: graduate schools to promote the next generation of scholars, clusters of excellence to promote cutting-edge research and "future concepts" for the project-based expansion of academic excellence at universities as a whole.
In order to qualify for this third area, a university had to have at least one internationally recognized academic center of excellence and a new graduate school.
After the first round of selections, LMU Munich was invited to submit applications for all three funding lines: It entered the competition with proposals for two graduate schools and four clusters of excellence.
On Friday 13 October 2006, a blue-ribbon panel announced the results of the Germany-wide Excellence Initiative for promoting top university research and education.
The panel, composed of the German Research Foundation and the German Science Council, has decided that LMU Munich will receive funding for all three areas covered by the Initiative: one graduate school, three "excellence clusters" and general funding for the university’s "future concept".
The university's main buildings are grouped around Geschwister-Scholl-Platz and Professor-Huber-Platz on Ludwigstrasse, extending into side streets such as Akademiestraße, Schellingstraße, and Veterinärstraße.
Other large campuses and institutes are located in Großhadern (Klinikum Großhadern), Martinsried (chemistry and biotechnology campus), the Ludwigsvorstadt (Klinikum Innenstadt) and in the Lehel (Institut am Englischen Garten), across from the main buildings, through the Englischer Garten.
The university's main building is situated in Geschwister-Scholl-Platz and the university's main campus is served by the Munich subway's Universität station.
Some notable subject areas which currently offer programmes in English include various fields of psychology, physics as well as business and management.
A list of current programmes offered in English can be accessed directly from the university's international website while a complete list of courses offered across all academic levels can be found here.
Faculties[edit]  LMU's Institute of Systematic Botany is located at Botanischer Garten München-Nymphenburg  Faculty of chemistry buildings at the Martinsried campus of LMU MunichThe university consists of 18 faculties which oversee various departments and institutes.
The official numbering of the faculties and the missing numbers 06 and 14 are the result of breakups and mergers of faculties in the past.
The Faculty of Forestry operations with number 06 has been integrated into the Technical University of Munich in 1999 and faculty number 14 has been merged with faculty number 13.
Because of this, students in Munich had to separately apply for the Munich Transport and Tariff Association's (MVV) monthly subscription which came at a significantly higher price as opposed to what a Semesterticket would have cost in other German cities.
50, totalling €222; this proposition narrowly fell through after voting was conducted across all the Munich universities as it was still deemed to be too pricey in comparison to the Semesterickets offered by other German cities, with students of the LMU Munich voting 52.
In 2012, a reconditioned package with a basic fee of €59 and a total price of €200 was finally accepted by an overwhelming majority of 86,3% of students across all universities.
In a 2010 human competitiveness index & analysis Human Resources & Labor Review published in Chasecareer Network, LMU Munich was the only German university listed in its list of the world's best 50 universities and was ranked 38th internationally.
Notable rival German universities in terms of rankings include TU München, Humboldt University, Heidelberg University and the Free University of Berlin.
Notable alumni and faculty members[edit]Main article: List of Ludwig Maximilians University of Munich peopleThe alumni of Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich played a major role in the development of quantum mechanics.
Max Planck, the founder of quantum theory and Nobel laureate in Physics in 1918, was an alumnus of the university.
Founders of quantum mechanics such as Werner Heisenberg, Wolfgang Pauli, and others were associated with the university.
Most recently, to honor the Nobel laureate in Chemistry Gerhard Ertl, who worked as a professor at the University of Munich from 1973–1986, the building of the Physical Chemistry was named after him.
Working under the guidance of Friedrich Hommel, Iqbal published his doctoral thesis in 1908 entitled: The Development of Metaphysics in Persia.
Pope Benedict XVI was a student and professor at LMU Munich Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1901 Theodor W.
Furthermore, it was venue for the constituent assembly of the state of Bavaria, where the current bavarian constitution was enacted.

de Jacobs University Bremen (previously International University Bremen, IUB) is an international, private residential university in Vegesack in Bremen-Nord, Bremen, Germany.
Jacobs University is an English-speaking higher education institution and combines aspects from the American and German academic systems.
The exact grading system follows the German one (from 1 the highest to 5 the lowest), and the study length is also 3 years as other German public and private universities.
In November 1997, a first exchange of ideas takes place between representatives of the City State of Bremen, Bremen University and Rice University, Houston, Texas.
The result: a recommendation to set up an international and highly selective private research university with a focus on science and engineering and English as the language of instruction.
In August 2001 the first 131 undergraduate students from 43 nations as well as 26 faculty members arrive on campus.
IUB, which then offers 14 study programs in engineering, the natural and social sciences as well as the humanities, becomes the first private university in Germany to be accredited by the German Council of Science and Humanities (Wissenschaftsrat).
It is the largest private donation ever bestowed onto a scientific institution in Europe and marks a major turning point in the university’s development.
In honor of the Jacobs Foundation’s remarkable donation IUB changes its name to Jacobs University Bremen in February 2007.

(October 2011) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) University of GiessenJustus-Liebig-Universität Gießen Siegel-uni-giessen.
gif   Main buildingThe University of Giessen, officially called Justus Liebig University Giessen (German: Justus-Liebig-Universität Gießen), is a large public research university in Giessen, Hesse, Germany.
It is named after its most famous faculty member, Justus von Liebig, the founder of modern agricultural chemistry and inventor of artificial fertiliser.
It covers the areas of arts/humanities, business, dentistry, economics, law, medicine, science, social sciences, and veterinary medicine.
Its university hospital, which has two sites, Gießen and Marburg (the latter of which is the teaching hospital of the University of Marburg), is the only private university hospital in Germany.
1 Growth in the student population2 Faculties and departments3 Campus4 Notable faculty and alumni5 Points of interest6 See also7 References8 External linksHistory[edit]The University of Giessen is among the oldest institutions of higher educations in the German-speaking world.
It was founded in 1607 as a Lutheran university in the city of Giessen in Hesse-Darmstadt because the all-Hessian Landesuniversität (the nearby University of Marburg (Philipps-Universität Marburg) in Marburg, Hesse-Kassel (or Hesse-Cassel)) had become Reformed (that is, Calvinist).
Louis V, Landgrave of Hesse-Darmstadt, whence the university got its original name "Ludoviciana," founded his own institution of higher education in Giessen, which as a Lutheran institution had the primary function of ensuring the education of pastors and civil servants.
Endowed with a charter issued by Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor, on 19 May 1607, the university was allowed to proceed with instruction in October 1607.
During the Thirty Years' War, when Hesse-Darmstadt was able to take the area around Marburg for itself, the university in Giessen ceased instruction and was moved back to its more long-standing location in Marburg (1624/25).
The Peace of Westphalia led to the restoration of the old location and in 1650 to the relocation of the university to Giessen.
In the 17th and 18th centuries the Ludoviciana was a typical small state university that then had the four common faculties (theology, law, medicine, and philosophy).
The instruction was reasonable, with about 20 to 25 professors teaching several hundred students, the latter of which were mostly "Landeskinder.
" In the 18th century came gradual modernization of the curricula and reforms in the instruction, which were definitively influenced by the local lordly court in Darmstadt.
The example for the reforms were both of the "model universities of the Enlightenment," the University of Halle, founded in 1694, and more still Georgia Augusta, founded in Göttingen in 1734/37.
The noteworthy creation of a Faculty of Economics (1777–1785) was ultimately was born out of this financial hardship.
In the Faculty of Economics, new practical subjects were brought together (veterinary medicine, forestry, and cameral sciences), which the university was supposed to make "expedient" and "profitable.
) After finishing studies in this Faculty, a number of these youths were able to gain recognition in the Faculties of Medicine and Philosophy.
They established the unusually diverse course offerings that continue to exist to the modern day at the University of Giessen.
The University of Giessen weathered the transition from the 18th to the 19th century unscathed and was still the only university of an enlarged territory, the Grand Duchy of Hesse.
Alongside Jena, Giessen was the prototype for the politicized Vormärz university, and the "Gießener Schwarzen" with Karl Follen and Georg Büchner, marked the revolutionary spirit of this decade.
With the appointment of the 21-year-old Justus von Liebig in 1824 through the Grand Duchy — against the will of the university on the recommendation of Alexander von Humboldt — a new era in the natural sciences began, not only in Giessen.
Young, promising scientists created a new impulse in their respective areas of knowledge; among these scientists were the antiquarian Friedrich Gottlieb Welcker, the lawyer Rudolf von Jhering, the theologian Adolf von Harnack, and the physicist Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen.
During this period, new clinics in human and veterinary medicine were established, and the university library received its first proper building.
With the creation of the university's central building (inaugurated 1880) and the adjacent newly constructed facilities for chemistry and physics a new cultural center was established on what was then the border of the city.
The decisive backer of this project was the last Grand Duke Ernst Ludwig, to whom the university bestowed out of thankfulness the honorary title of "Rector Magnificentissimus.
For the first time included in the student body were women, who since 1900 were admitted as guest students and starting in 1908 were admitted for regular study.
After the different Hessian states were (re-)united in 1929, both universities became public universities of that German state.
The University of Giessen now has almost 23,000 students and 8,500 employees, which together with the University of Applied Sciences Giessen-Friedberg, makes Giessen the most student-dominated German city.
Growth in the student population[edit]Following is the growth in the student population of the University of GiessenIn the 2014/2015 winter semester the student population exceeded the mark of more than a total of 28,000 students and 7,000 first-semester students for the first time.
A number of faculty buildings and lecture theaters are located there, including Audimax, a building containing several lecture halls whose atrium is often the venue for concerts and disco nights, locally known as "Uni-Partys.
[citation needed] They include the German romantic dramatist and revolutionary Georg Büchner, the literary and political historian Georg Gottfried Gervinus and the botanist Johann Jacob Dillenius.
Schenck, who received his PhD in Forestry from Giessen, founded Biltmore Forest School, the first such school in the United States.
The Holocaust Literature Research Unit of the university plans to publish My Opposition, Friedrich Kellner's World War II diary.
[citation needed] Friedrich Kellner was chief justice inspector in Laubach from 1933 to 1950 and also district auditor for the region of Giessen.

jpeg   Count of students from 1976 to 2015  One of FU Hagen's main buildings located in HagenThe University of Hagen (German: FernUniversität in Hagen, informally often referred to as FU Hagen) is a public research university that is primarily focused on distance teaching.
While its main campus is located in Hagen, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany, the university maintains more than 50 study and research centers in Germany and throughout Europe.
The university was founded in 1974 as a public research university by the state Nordrhein-Westfalen and began its research and teaching activities in 1975.
It was founded following the idea of UK's Open University to provide higher and continuing education opportunities through a distance education system in Germany.
The university awards the same qualifications as other German on-campus universities and maintains the same high requirements.
Besides the substantial number of off-campus students, a considerable number of full-time postgraduate research students as well as more than 1,800 members of academic and research staff are based on the University of Hagen's main campus in Hagen.
The faculties of the University of Hagen award undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral degrees (bachelor's, master's, doctorate degrees (Ph.
All the degrees awarded by the University of Hagen are equivalent to those awarded by traditional German universities and uphold rigorous academic standards.
The University of Hagen is awarding degrees and is doing research in the fields of Business Administration and Economics, Mathematics, Computer Science, Law, Psychology, Cultural Sciences and Political Science.
All this inspired the then minister of Higher Education and Research of the state North Rhine Westphalia to establish a public research university at Hagen dedicated to distance teaching.
Under the NRW-Foundation Law of 1 December 1974 the "pioneers" from academia and administration had only ten months for preparing the new university, so that 1,300 students could embark on their studies from winter academic term 1975/76.
The two academic departments of economics and mathematics were soon joined by business administration, education, cultural sciences, social sciences and humanities, as well as electrical engineering, information technology, law and computer science.
Simultaneously with the FernUniversität, the first study centres in North Rhine - Westphalia started operating.
According to the Bologna Process every course offered by the university has been transformed to bachelor's and master's degrees.
Organisation and administration[edit]Governance[edit]The Rectorate is the 'executive body' of the university, headed by rector Helmut Hoyer.
The rector and the members of the rectorate are senators ex officio, as are also the deans of the faculties, and the university's equal opportunities officer.
Another 20 senators are elected for four-year terms, within the following quotas: eight university professors; four academic staff; four delegates of the student body; and four employees of the university administration.
Amongst others its members include many CEOs of German industries, it formerly also included the late President of Germany Johannes Rau.
Faculties[edit]After a 2006 structural reformation, the university consists of 4 faculties, which in turn comprise several disciplines, departments, and institutes.
A notable exception is the undergraduate program in law, from which students still graduate with the Staatsexamen (state examination), a central examination at Master's level held by the State of North Rhine-Westphalia.
The development of FernUniversität's campus near the roadways A 45 and A 46 began in 1980 with the first office building Allgemeines Verfügungszentrum (AVZ I).
As more and more university buildings are concentrated on the Campus, it has become easier for the academic staff of different academic areas to cooperate and engage in cross-disciplinary research.
Furthermore, as a distance university, the University of Hagen operates numerous regional and study centers located across Germany and in other European countries, which are an important aspect of the university's blended learning concept.
At these regional and study centers students attend mandatory seminars and preparatory classes for exams, study together with other students, borrow books, and find mentors.
Additionally, the University of Hagen offers presence classes and special seminars, some of which are required to graduate successfully.
The standard time required to finish a Bachelor's degree's course load of 180 ECTS in full-time study is set at six semesters.
However, since a large proportion of the student body at the University of Hagen is studying in part-time, the regular study time can deviate but is not allowed to exceed a specific number of semesters.
Research[edit]  FTK - Research Institute for Telecommunication and Cooperation which is maintained by the University of Hagen and the University of WuppertalThe University of Hagen supports focus- and profile-oriented research.
Interdisciplinary and cross-faculty collaboration leads to the grouping together of competencies and to the formation of competitive research focal points.
Furthermore, exchange of technology and knowledge is conducted through a variety of cooperation projects between science and industry, ranging from final theses by arrangement with the individual employer to commissioned research.
Moreover, joint development of academic further education programs with companies, associations and scientific institutions contributes to the interlinking of academia and practice.
The FU Hagen, its faculties and institutions cooperate closely with numerous institutions of higher education (both traditional and distance teaching universities) and scientific institutions all over the world.
The international cooperation agreements comprise all areas of the university: teaching, studies, research, administration and system development.
They are complemented by the FernUniversität's active membership in European and international associations and networks, and by the numerous international cooperation projects resulting from these.
Since the 1980s the University of Hagen has operated study centres on a joint basis with partner institutions abroad – first in the German-speaking countries and later also in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe.
These study centers aim to spread information about the German language-based programs of study offered via modern distance education, and they are intended to support students of the university.
Furthermore, the faculties of the FernUniversität and their international partner institutions of higher education jointly offer programs of study leading to international dual degrees.
Ranking and reputation[edit]The special status of the FernUniversität Hagen as a university for distance learning mostly excludes the university from being ranked in general rankings.
Only the renowned CHE ranking included the university in its university ranking of 2005 and evaluated the quality of the subjects Economics, Sociology and Business Administration.
The departments of sociology and business administration received stellar placements - both research intensity and quality were emphasised to be in line with those of other top placed departments of on-campus universities.
Student life[edit]Student body[edit]The University of Hagen had a student body of 83,536 students in the summer term of 2013.
About 80% of the students at the FU Hagen are in full or part-time employment and 19% have already received a first academic degree.

Founded in 1947 by the French occupational authorities as a grande école, today it is operated under the joint responsibility of both the Federal Republic (Bund) and all 16 German states (Länder).
It runs four Master's programs, grants doctoral degrees and habilitations, offers a postgraduate certificate program, and administers programs of executive education.
Noted alumni and faculty include former President of Germany Roman Herzog, former President of the Bundesbank Helmut Schlesinger, former Attorney General of Germany Alexander von Stahl, and CEO of BASF Jürgen Strube.
Created as a sister institution to École Nationale d'Administration, it was the first and only German school to employ the French grande école model.
In 1950 it was formally established as a German institution of public law with legal capacity and entrusted with "fostering the administrative sciences in education and research".
In 1961 and 1970 respectively, it was bestowed with the right to grant habilitations and doctorates, thereby receiving full university status.
The school is the only German university run jointly by the Federal Republic (Bund) and all 16 German states (Länder).
Academic programs[edit]  Otto Mayer House  Main Auditorium  Lobby of the Otto Mayer HouseThe university offers programs leading to a postgraduate certificate and master's degrees.
The language of instruction is predominantly German, although each year a series of seminar courses offered in cooperation with Indiana University School of Public and Environmental Affairs is delivered in English language.
In 2015 the cooperation expanded to include the University of Southern California's Price School of Public Policy.
Master's students may earn the European Master of Public Administration diploma by studying an additional semester abroad at one of the twelve partner schools in the EMPA network.
The Master of Administrative Sciences (Magister rerum publicarum) is the school's traditional flagship program.
It is a one-year postgraduate program open to students holding an additional graduate-level degree, preferably in law, economics, history, or sociology.
The program comprises two terms at the school, an eight-week internship at German or European institutions, and a subsequent period of three months to write the master's thesis and pass an oral examination.
The Master of Arts in Administrative Sciences is a two-year interdisciplinary program focusing on public administration in an international context.
First year students follow a core curriculum consisting of six modules on administrative, legal, economic, methodological, and strategic topics, and complete a mandatory eight-week internship.
The Master of Arts in Public Economy is a two-year program dedicated to the study of the public economic sector from an interdisciplinary perspective.
Second-year students complete four deepening modules in Public Finance, Competition and Regulation, Procurement, and Public Corporate Governance, choose one optional module on Public Enterprises, or Infrastructure, and write a master's thesis.
The Master of Public Administration in Higher Education and Research Management is a two-year part-time program for professional university or research institute administrators.
The university runs doctoral programs in administrative sciences (Doctor rerum publicarum), law (Doctor juris), and political sciences and economy (Doctor rerum politicarum).
Doctoral candidates are required to complete one year of coursework in residence at the school, and produce a dissertation which makes a creditable contribution to scholarship in its field.
The school's executive education provides in-service training for senior civil servants of all government levels.
The seminars, workshops and conferences deal with contemporary problems of administration, legislation, and European affairs.
The Speyer Leadership College (Führungskolleg Speyer) is a two-year in-service program preparing senior executives holding at least the rank of a Government Director to assume higher positions.
Admission and fees[edit]Admission to the school is competitive and is limited to 25 seats per program and year for the M.
Formal minimum entry requirement for all degree programs is a class rank among the top third in the previous academic degree program.
The German state heavily subsidizes university study to keep higher education affordable regardless of socio-economic background.
Like most German public universities, Speyer charges no tuition fees for academic programs, for both EU and non-EU citizens.
Research[edit]The university performs "fundamental research with high relevance to practice", and regularly publishes treatises on administrative, legal, political, and economic matters in the Speyer University Monograph Series (Schriftenreihe der Hochschule Speyer).

Heidelberg University,   (Redirected from University of Heidelberg)Jump to: navigation, search This article is about the university in Germany.
Founded in 1386 on instruction of Pope Urban VI, Heidelberg is Germany's oldest university and one of the world's oldest surviving universities.
The university consists of twelve faculties and offers degree programmes at undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral levels in some 100 disciplines.
Heidelberg comprises three major campuses: the humanities are predominantly located in Heidelberg's Old Town, the natural sciences and medicine in the Neuenheimer Feld quarter, and the social sciences within the inner-city suburb Bergheim.
The language of instruction is usually German, while a considerable number of graduate degrees are offered in English.
Modern scientific psychiatry, psychopharmacology, psychiatric genetics, environmental physics, and modern sociology were introduced as scientific disciplines by Heidelberg faculty.
Approximately 1,000 doctorates are completed every year, with more than one third of the doctoral students coming from abroad.
International students from some 130 countries account for more than 20 percent of the entire student body.
Internationally renowned and consistently ranked among Europe's top universities, Heidelberg is a German Excellence University, as well as a founding member of the League of European Research Universities and the Coimbra Group.

Founding[edit] Rupert I founded Heidelberg University in 1386The Great Schism of 1378 made it possible for Heidelberg, a relatively small city and capital of the Electorate of the Palatinate, to gain its own university.
The Great Schism was initiated by the election of two popes after the death of Pope Gregory XI in the same year.
One successor resided in Avignon (elected by the French) and the other in Rome (elected by the Italian cardinals).
The German secular and spiritual leaders voiced their support for the successor in Rome, which had far-reaching consequences for the German students and teachers in Paris: they lost their stipends and had to leave.
Rupert I recognized the opportunity and initiated talks with the Curia, which ultimately led to a Papal Bull for foundation of a university.
After having received, on 23 October 1385, permission from pope Urban VI to create a school of general studies (Latin: studium generale), the final decision to found the university was taken on 26 June 1386 at the behest of Rupert I, Count Palatine of the Rhine.
As specified in the papal charter, the university was modelled after University of Paris and included four faculties: philosophy, theology, jurisprudence, and medicine.
On 18 October 1386 a special Pontifical High Mass in the Heiliggeistkirche was the ceremony that established the university.
Early development[edit]  A solemn holy Mass was offered in the Heiliggeistkirche in 1386 to mark and bless the establishment of the University (photo ca.
Between 1414 and 1418, theology and jurisprudence professors of the university took part in the Council of Constance and acted as counselors for Louis III, who attended this council as representative of the emperor and chief magistrate of the realm.
In 1412, both realism and the teachings of John Wycliffe were forbidden at the university but later, around 1454, the university decided that realism or via antique would also be taught, thus introducing two parallel ways (ambae viae).
The transition from scholastic to humanistic culture was effected by the chancellor and bishop Johann von Dalberg in the late 15th century.
Humanism was represented at Heidelberg University particularly by the founder of the older German Humanistic School Rudolph Agricola, Conrad Celtes, Jakob Wimpfeling, and Johann Reuchlin.
Æneas Silvius Piccolomini was chancellor of the university in his capacity of provost of Worms, and later always favored it with his friendship and good-will as Pope Pius II.
In 1482, Pope Sixtus IV permitted laymen and married men to be appointed professors in the ordinary of medicine through a papal dispensation.
Martin Luther's disputation at Heidelberg in April 1518 made a lasting impact, and his adherents among the masters and scholars soon became leading Reformationists in Southwest Germany.
With the Electorate of the Palatinate turn to the Reformed faith, Otto Henry, Elector Palatine, converted the university into a calvinistic institution.
In 1563, the Heidelberg Catechism was created under collaboration of members of the university's divinity school.
As the 16th century was passing, the late humanism stepped beside Calvinism as a predominant school of thought; and figures like Paul Schede, Jan Gruter, Martin Opitz, and Matthäus Merian taught at the university.
However, with the beginning of the Thirty Years' War in 1618, the intellectual and fiscal wealth of the university declined.
In 1622, the then-world-famous Bibliotheca Palatina (the library of the university) was stolen from the University Cathedral and taken to Rome.
The reconstruction efforts thereafter were defeated by the troops of King Louis XIV, who destroyed Heidelberg in 1693 almost completely.
 The Old University from 1735 is today the seat of the Rector and the University SenateAs a consequence of the late Counter-Reformation, the university lost its Protestant character, and was channeled by Jesuits.
Through the efforts of the Jesuits a preparatory seminary was established, the Seminarium ad Carolum Borromæum, whose pupils were also registered in the university.
After the suppression of the Jesuit Order, most of the schools they had conducted passed into the hands of the French Congregation of Lazarists in 1773.
He also founded an observatory in the neighboring city of Mannheim, where Jesuit Christian Mayer labored as director.
In connection with the four hundredth anniversary of the university, the elector approved a revised statute book that several professors had been commissioned to prepare.
As a consequence of the disturbances caused by the French Revolution, and particularly because of the Treaty of Lunéville, the university lost all its property on the left bank of the Rhine, so that its complete dissolution was expected.
19th and early 20th century[edit]This decline did not stop until 1803, when the university was reestablished as a state-owned institution by Karl Friedrich, Grand Duke of Baden, to whom the part of the Palatinate situated on the right bank of the Rhine was allotted.
Karl Friedrich divided the university into five faculties and placed himself at its head as rector, as did also his successors.
During this decade Romanticism found expression in Heidelberg through Clemens Brentano, Achim von Arnim, Ludwig Tieck, Joseph Görres, and Joseph von Eichendorff, and there went forth a revival of the German Middle Ages in speech, poetry, and art.
After Romanticism had eventually died out, Heidelberg became a center of Liberalism and the movement in favor of German national unity.
The historians Friedrich Christoph Schlosser and Georg Gottfried Gervinus were the guides of the nation in political history.
The modern scientific schools of medicine and natural science, particularly astronomy, were models in point of construction and equipment, and Heidelberg University was especially noted for its influential law school.
The university as a whole became the role model for the transformation of American liberal arts colleges into research universities, in particular for the then-newly established Johns Hopkins University.
Heidelberg's professors were important supporters of the Vormärz revolution and many of them were members of the first freely elected German parliament, the Frankfurt Parliament of 1848.
During the late 19th century, the university housed a very liberal and open-minded spirit, which was deliberately fostered by Max Weber, Ernst Troeltsch and a circle of colleagues around them.
In the Weimar Republic, the university was widely recognized as a center of democratic thinking, coined by professors like Karl Jaspers, Gustav Radbruch, Martin Dibelius and Alfred Weber.
Unfortunately, there were also dark forces working within the university: Nazi physicist Philipp Lenard was head of the physical institute during that time.
Following the assassination of the liberal German-Jewish Foreign Minister Walther Rathenau, he refused to half mast the national flag on the institute, thereby provoking its storming by communist students.
During the Third Reich[edit]With the advent of the Third Reich in 1933, the university supported the Nazis like all other German universities at the time.
Many dissident fellows had to emigrate and most Jewish and Communist professors that did not leave Germany were deported.
On 17 May 1933, members of the university faculty and students took part in book burnings at Universitätsplatz ("University Square") and Heidelberg eventually became infamous as a NSDAP university.
The inscription above the main entrance of the New University was changed from "The Living Spirit" to "The German Spirit", and many professors paid homage to the new motto.
The university was involved in Nazi eugenics: forced sterilizations were carried out at the women's clinic and the psychiatric clinic, then directed by Carl Schneider, was involved in Action T4 Euthanasia program.
Federal Republic[edit]Since Heidelberg was spared from destruction during World War II, the reconstruction of the university was realized rather quickly.
With the foundation of the Collegium Academicum, Heidelberg University became the home of Germany's first and, until today, only self-governed student hall.
Shortly thereafter, the building of the Collegium Academicum, a progressive college in immediate vicinity to the university's main grounds, was stormed by over 700 police officers and closed once and for all.
On the outskirts of the city, in the Neuenheimer Feld area, a large campus for medicine and natural sciences was constructed.
In 2007, and again in 2012, the university was appointed University of Excellence under an initiative started by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research and the German Research Foundation.
This enhanced the German university system by establishing a small network of exceptionally well-funded universities, which are expected to generate strong international appeal.
Campuses[edit]Main article: Heidelberg"I saw Heidelberg on a perfectly clear morning, with a pleasant air both cool and invigorating.
4 million people living there, comprising the neighboring cities of Heidelberg, Mannheim, Ludwigshafen, and a number of smaller towns in the perimeter.
Heidelberg is known as the cradle of Romanticism, and its old town and castle are among the most frequented tourist destinations in Germany.
The sciences faculties and the medical school, including three large university hospitals, are located on the New Campus in the Neuenheimer Feld on the outskirts of Heidelberg.
It is situated at the Universitätsplatz (University Square) in the pedestrian zone, in direct vicinity to the University Library and to the main administration buildings.
Its erection was largely financed by donations of wealthy American families, in line with a fundraising campaign of Jacob Gould Schurman, an alumnus of Heidelberg University and former United States Ambassador to Germany.
It houses the new assembly hall, the largest lecture halls, and a number of smaller seminar rooms, mostly used by faculties of humanities and social sciences.
Education in humanities and social sciences takes place to a great extent in buildings spread over the ancient part of town, though most are less than ten minutes walk from University Square.
New Campus[edit]Main article: New Campus (University of Heidelberg)  Aerial perspective on the New Campus in the Neuenheimer Feld.
It is now the largest part of the university, and the largest campus for natural sciences and life science in Germany.
Almost all science faculties and institutes, the medical school, University Hospital Heidelberg, and the science branch of the University Library are situated on the New Campus.
Several independent research institutes, such as the German Cancer Research Center and two of the Max-Planck-Institutes have settled there.
The Neuenheimer Feld campus has extensive parking lots for faculty and student vehicles for long term and short term parking, as well as visitors and patients of the various university hospitals.
The Faculty of Physics and Astronomy is not located on either campus, but on the Philosophers' Walk, separated from the Old Town by the River Neckar, and some 2 km (1.
Bergheim Campus[edit]The Bergheim Campus is located in the former Ludolf Krehl clinic (named after Ludolf von Krehl) in the inner-city suburb of Heidelberg-Bergheim.
Since March 2009 it has housed the institutes economics, political science, and sociology (together the Heidelberg University Faculty of Economics and Social Sciences) that formerly resided at the Old Town campus.
The Bergheim campus offers one lecture theatre, several seminar rooms, the most modern of the university libraries, and a cafe (rather than the full cafeteria present in the other campuses).
It is Germany's most frequently used library, and it is currently placed 1st in a ranking of Germany's best libraries.
2 million books, about 500,000 other media such as microfilms and video tapes, as well as 10,732 scientific periodicals.
Moreover, it holds 6,600 manuscripts, most notably the Codex Manesse, 1,800 incunabula, 110,500 autographs, and a collection of old maps, paintings, and photographs.
The University Library of today traces its roots back to the purchase of a chest of documents by the first Rector Marsilius von Inghen in 1388, which was stored in the Heiliggeistkirche, then the University Cathedral.
Since 1978, the science branch of the University Library serves the institutes of natural sciences and medicine on the New Campus.
Facilities abroad[edit]  Heidelberg Center in Santiago, ChileHeidelberg University founded a Center for Latin America in Santiago, Chile in 2001.
It has the task of organizing, managing, and marketing the courses of study maintained either independently by Heidelberg University or in cooperation with the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile and the University of Chile.
It also coordinates the activities of Heidelberg University in Latin America, and provides a platform for scientific cooperation.
Its main tasks include promoting existing collaborations, building up new networks, creating joint study programs, and maintaining and expanding academic contacts with American universities.
In addition, the Heidelberg South Asia Institute maintains branch offices in New Delhi, India; Islamabad, Pakistan; Kathmandu, Nepal; and Colombo, Sri Lanka.
Organization[edit]Governance[edit]The Rectorate is the 'executive body' of the university, headed by rector Bernhard Eitel.
The rector and the members of the rectorate are senators ex officio, as are also the deans of the faculties, as well as the medical and managing directors of the University Hospital, and the university's equal opportunities officer.
Another 20 senators are elected for four-year terms, within the following quotas: eight university professors; four academic staff; four delegates of the student body; and four employees of the university administration.
The University Council is the advisory board to the aforementioned entities and encompasses, among others, the former Israeli Ambassador to Germany Avi Primor, as well as CEOs of German industries.
Faculties[edit]After a 2003 structural reformation, the university consists of 12 faculties, which in turn comprise several disciplines, departments, and institutes.
Notable exceptions are the undergraduate programs in law, medicine, dentistry and pharmacy, from which students still graduate with the State Examination, a central examination at Master's level held by the State of Baden-Württemberg.
As of 2008, the faculty encompasses 4,196 full-time staff, excluding visiting professors as well as graduate research and teaching assistants.
Heidelberg University also attracts more than 500 international scholars as visiting professors each academic year.
23,636 students pursue taught degrees, 4,114 of whom are international students, and 919 are international exchange students.
3,105 students pursue a doctoral degree, including 1,004 international doctoral students and 15 international exchange students.
The ranking was based on a survey among recruiters and managers of leading international companies from twenty countries.
•The Shanghai Jiao Tong University's Academic Ranking of World Universities ranks Heidelberg 1st nationally and 46th in the world as of 2015.
In the rankings of broad subject areas, Heidelberg ranks globally 29th in life sciences and medicine, 36th in arts & humanities, 39th in natural sciences,144th in social sciences and management, and 214th in engineering & technology.
•According to the Third European Report on Science & Technology Indicators compiled by the European Commission, Heidelberg ranks 4th nationally and 9th in Europe.
•The Times (London) referred to Heidelberg University as "the oldest and most eminent in the country of Luther and Einstein" and as "the jewel of German learning".
Organisation and length of courses[edit]  Main auditorium in the New UniversityThe academic year is divided into two semesters.
The standard time required to finish a Bachelor's degree is principally six semesters, and a further four semesters for consecutive Master's degrees.
Admission[edit]In the winter-semester 2006/2007, the university offered 3,926 places in undergraduate programs restricted by numerus clausus, with an overall acceptance rate of 16.
Most selective are the undergraduate programs in clinical medicine, molecular biotechnology, political science, and law, with acceptance rates of 3.
The selection is exercised by allocating the best qualified applicants to a given number of places available in the respective discipline, thus depending primarily on the chosen subjects and the grade point average of the Abitur or its equivalent.
For some majors and minors in humanities—particularly for conceptually non-vocational like classics and ancient history—unrestricted admission is granted under certain criteria (e.
Admission to consecutive Master's programs always requires at least an undergraduate degree equivalent to the German grade "good" (i.
admission prerequisite is normally a strong Master's-level degree, but specific admission procedures vary and cannot be generalized.
International applicants usually make up considerably more than 20% of the applicant pool and are considered individually by the merits achieved in their respective country of origin.

for undergraduate, consecutive Master's, and doctoral programs, for both EU and non-EU citizens, and for any subject area.
In the fiscal year 2005, Heidelberg University had an overall operating budget of approximately €856 M, consisting of approximately €413 M government funds, approximately €311 M basic budget, and approximately €132 M from external grants.
Additionally, the university receives another €150 M in research grants, distributed over 5 years from 2012 onwards, due to the German Universities Excellence Initiative.
In the fiscal year 2007, the university for the first time raised approximately €19 M through tuition fees, exclusively to further improve the conditions of study.
5 M of these were spent at the end of the year and the rectorate had to urge the faculties to make use of their additional means.
Modern scientific psychiatry; psychopharmacology; psychiatric genetics; environmental physics; and modern sociology were introduced as scientific disciplines by Heidelberg faculty.
Almost 800 dwarf planets, the North America Nebula, and the return of Halley's Comet have been discovered and documented at institutes of the Heidelberg Center for Astronomy.

Student unions structure themselves as "Studierendenrat" (Student body council) as well as on department level.
Heidelberg's student newspaper "ruprecht" is — with editions of more than 10,000 copies — one of Germany's largest student-run newspapers.
The jury of journalists from major newspapers commended its "well balanced, though critical attitude" and its "simply great" layout that "suffices highest professional demands.
" The ruprecht is financed entirely by advertising revenues, thus retaining independence from university management.
However, the critical online student newspaper UNiMUT, which is run by the joint student council of the faculties, criticized the ruprecht often for being conformed, and exceedingly layout-oriented.
The journal is published quarterly, at the beginning and end of each semester break, and is circulated throughout all of Germany.
As traditional symbols (couleur) corporation members wear colored caps and ribbons at ceremonial occasions (Kommers) and some still practice the traditional academic fencing, a kind of duel, to "shape their members for the challenges of life.
Adjacent to University Square is Heidelberg's major night life district, where one pub is placed next to each other.

Kleine Geschichte der Stadt Heidelberg und ihrer Universität [Short history of the city of Heidelberg and its University] (in German).
de AulaThe Neue Aula Eberhard Karls University, Tübingen (German: Eberhard Karls Universität Tübingen; Latin: Universitas Eberhardina Carolina) is a public research university located in the city of Tübingen, Baden-Württemberg.
It is one of Germany's most famous and oldest universities, noted in medicine, natural sciences, and the humanities.
In the area of German Studies (German: Germanistik) it has been ranked first among all German universities for many years, and is known as a centre for the study of theology and religion.
Tübingen is one of five classical "university towns" in Germany; the other four being Marburg, Göttingen, Freiburg and Heidelberg.
[citation needed] The university is associated with some Nobel laureates, especially in the fields of medicine and chemistry.
Its present name was conferred on it in 1769 by Duke Karl Eugen who appended his first name to that of the founder (Karls being the possessive form of Karl).
The Alte AulaThe University of Tübingen has a history of innovative thought, particularly in theology, in which the university and the Tübinger Stift are famous to this day.
Philipp Melanchthon (1497–1560), the prime mover in building the German school system and a chief figure in the Protestant Reformation, helped establish its direction.
Among Tübingen's eminent students (and/or professors) have been the astronomer Johannes Kepler; the economist Horst Köhler (President of Germany); Joseph Ratzinger (Pope Benedict XVI), poet Friedrich Hölderlin, and the philosophers Friedrich Schelling and Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel.
Theologian Helmut Thielicke revived postwar Tübingen when he took over a professorship at the reopened theological faculty in 1947, being made administrative head of the university and President of the Chancellor's Conference in 1951.
" The University of Tübingen also was the first German university to establish a faculty of natural sciences, in 1863.
Christiane Nüsslein-Volhard, the first female Nobel Prize winner in medicine in Germany, also works at Tübingen.
The faculty for economics and business was founded in 1817 as the "Staatswissenschaftliche Fakultät" and was the first of its kind in Germany.
Nazi period[edit]Main article: University education in Nazi GermanyThe University played a leading role in efforts to legitimize the policies of the Third Reich as "scientific".
Even before the victory of the Nazi Party in the general election in March 1933, there were hardly any Jewish faculty and a few Jewish students.
Religion professor Traugott Konstantin Oesterreich and the mathematician Erich Kamke were forced to take early retirement, probably in both cases the non-Aryan origin of their wives.
After the war[edit]In 1966, Joseph Ratzinger, who would later become Pope Benedict XVI, was appointed to a chair in dogmatic theology at Tübingen, where he was a colleague of Hans Küng.
In 1970 the university was restructured into a series of faculties as independent departments of study and research after the manner of French universities.
After the death of Tübingen's influential Marxist philosopher Ernst Bloch, who has served as a role model for many German students, Tübingen was unofficially renamed as "Ernst-Bloch-University".
Until today the unofficial university logo shows a clenched fist - a popular gesture of student protest since Bloch.
The university made the headlines in November 2009 when a group of left-leaning students occupied one of the main lecture halls, the Kupferbau, for several days.
In May 2010 Tübingen joined the Matariki Network of Universities (MNU) together with Dartmouth College (USA), Durham University (UK), Queen’s University (Canada), University of Otago (New Zealand), University of Western Australia (Australia) and Uppsala University (Sweden).
Research focus[edit]The University of Tübingen undertakes a broad range of research projects in various fields.
In the liberal arts, the University of Tübingen is noteworthy for having the only faculty of rhetoric in Germany – the department was founded by Walter Jens, an important intellectual and literary critic.
The university also boasts continued pre-eminence in its centuries-old traditions of research in the fields of philosophy, theology and philology.
Since at least the nineteenth century, Tübingen has been the home of world-class research in prehistoric studies and the study of antiquity, including the study of the ancient Near East; a particular focus of the research in these areas at the University of Tübingen has been Anatolia, e.
Campus[edit]The University of Tübingen is not a campus university, but is spread throughout the town: Tübingen is one of five classical "university towns" in Germany.
•The university uses a number of buildings in the old town of Tübingen, some of which date back to the foundation of the university.
Today, these are mainly used by smaller humanities departments, as is the adjacent castle, Schloss Hohentübingen.
•Northeast of the old town, the Wilhelmstraße area surrounding the street of the same name is home to larger humanities departments as well as the university's administration.
•A new campus for the sciences was built in the 1970s at Morgenstelle, on a hill north of the historic centre of Tübingen.
•The university's teaching hospitals are located between the Wilhelmstraße area and the Morgenstelle campus in an area collectively known as the Klinikum.
The 17 hospitals in Tübingen affiliated with the university's faculty of medicine have 1,500 patient beds, and cater to 66,000 in-patients and 200,000 out-patients on an annual basis.
The largest of the eleven halls of residence are at Waldhäuser Ost (1,700 rooms) and in the Französisches Viertel (500 rooms).
Libraries[edit]  Library: BonatzbauThe University Library of Tübingen is not just available to those affiliated with the university, but also to the general public.
Apart from the main library, more than 80 departmental libraries containing an additional three million volumes are also associated with the university.
•The library's main building, constructed in 1963, contains the information desk and research stations to access electronic catalogues and databases.
Built in 2002, it offers users direct access to over 300,000 volumes and latest issues of newspapers, magazines and journals.
Organisation[edit]Faculties[edit]The university is made up of 14 faculties, some of which are subdivided into further departments.
The current rector, Professor Bernd Engler, is supported by four deputies consisting of three prorectors and one provost.
Apart from the members of the rectorate, it includes the equal opportunities commissioner, the deans and 20 elected members representing the professors, lecturers, students and non-academic staff.
The University Council (Hochschulrat or Universitätsrat) has 13 members, including its president and vice-president as well as five further internal and six external members.
Reputation[edit]The University of Tübingen is associated with several Nobel laureates, especially in the fields of medicine and chemistry.
In 2012 the University of Tübingen was awarded for its future concept "Research – Relevance – Responsibility" in the course of the German Universities Excellence Initiative.
According to The Times Higher Education Supplement (2016) Tübingen is one of the 78 best universities in the world and one of the 48 world-beating universities in Arts and Humanities.
Since some of the most influential Protestant and Catholic theologians of the 20th century have been trained there, the University of Tübingen is especially renowned in the fields of Theology and Philosophy of Religion.
The Eberhard Karls University is the only university in the German-speaking world that teaches rhetoric as an independent subject of study.
Moreover, in the area of German Studies (German: Germanistik) Tübingen has been ranked first among all German universities for many years.
Students from the University of Tübingen can study within the framework of study exchange programs (without tuition fees) at these foreign partner universities, too.
Student life[edit]  Sculpture Urpferd at campus MorgenstelleAs the university's students make up roughly a third of the total population of Tübingen, the town's culture is to a large extent dominated by them.
Consequently, there is a slump of activity during university holidays, particularly over the summer, when a large number of otherwise regular events do not take place.
While famous for their parties, public academic lectures and the yearly "Stocherkahn-Rennen" punting-boat race on the Neckar river, some of them are the subject of ongoing controversy surrounding alleged rightwing policial views, leading to strong criticism from leftist groups.
Also closely linked to the university are a number of student societies representing mainly the arts and political parties.
Most notable are a number of choirs as well as student theatre groups affiliated with the faculty of Modern Languages, some of which perform in foreign languages.
Radio Uniwelle Tübingen is the university's radio station, airing seven hours of programmes a week produced by students under the supervision of staff employed by the university.
Since Tübingen has a department of sports science with a broad range of facilities, students of other subjects have the possibility to participate in various kinds of sports courses in teams or as individuals.
The sports department is located close to the Wilhelmstraße area of university buildings and is served by a number of frequent bus routes.
Cinemas and the town council's public library in particular do not offer discounts for students, and there are only a handful of restaurants which have reduced lunch deals.
However, students may benefit from the Semesterticket, a heavily discounted public transport season pass offering six months of unlimited travel on trains and buses in the naldo Verkehrsverbund transport association for approximately €62.
Nightlife in Tübingen is centered on the numerous pubs in the old town along with a number of clubs, most of which dedicate themselves to non-mainstream music.
During the semester, the Studentenwerk-owned Clubhaus at the centre of the Wilhelmstraße university area hosts the weekly Clubhausfest on Thursday nights.
This popular, free-entry club night is organized and promoted by student societies and Fachschaft student representative bodies and all proceeds go towards their activities in support of students.

[citation needed] Since almost all German universities are public (most private universities do not have the official German "Universitätsstatus"), and therefore mainly paid by taxes and generally egalitarian, there is no German Ivy League of institutions of higher education.
Moreover, the German Universities Excellence Initiative is a publicity-laden fund for specific research projects only.
It aims to promote cutting-edge research, to create outstanding conditions for young scientists at universities, and to strengthen some selected universities more than others in order to raise their international visibility.
This self-conception is also of historical interest: from 1900 to 1929 members of the Studentenverbindungen in Tübingen already understood themselves as the German national elite ("Führer der Nation").
Every May until 2008, duelling fraternities of the "Tübinger Waffenring" organized a big torchlight procession and sang traditional German and Germanic songs in the old town ("Maieinsingen"), accompanied by huge anti-nationalistic counter-demonstrations of left-wing student groups.
In 1969, the progressive political and theological climate alienated Professor Joseph Ratzinger (who later became Pope Benedict XVI) and led to his short-lived tenure at the university.
According to the Swabian daily newspaper, the Schwäbisches Tagblatt, Ratzinger was theologically "traumatized" at the University of Tübingen.
In Aus meinem Leben: Erinnerungen he describes the liberalism of Tübingen's student activism as "the cruel countenance of this atheistic devoutness" ("das grausame Antlitz dieser atheistischen Frömmigkeit").

Some academic activities of the computer science and Systems engineering departments are held at the Fürstenallee campus.
The museum exhibits historic computing technologies used during different eras of human civilization starting from 3000 BC to world war.
The Fürstenallee campus houses the research centers such as Heinz Nixdorf Institute, Cooperative Computing and Communication Laboratory (C-Lab) and Software quality lab (S-lab).
III Faculty of Science[edit]The faculty of Science has three departments: Department of Physics; Department of Chemistry; Department of Sports and Health.
The department of Physics offers Master of Science and Doctoral degree programs in English and is fully accredited by ASIIN.
The research topic specializes in fabrication, characterization, spectroscopy, and applications of semiconductor nanostructures, optical communication, quantum computing and the theoretical understanding and modeling of the underlying physical phenomena.
In addition, a variety of multifaced cooperations between Mechanical Engineering departments and local companies help to promote long-term innovation in the proud tradition of German industry.
A ranking recently published by the Association for Computing Machinery placed the department's Software Engineering the 16th best in the world, and top in Germany.
The most recent German CHE ranking placed Paderborn's CS department among the top four CS departments in Germany.

png The University of Rostock (Rostock University, German: Universität Rostock) is a public university located in Rostock, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Germany.
It is the oldest and largest university in continental northern Europe and the Baltic Sea area, and 8th oldest in Central Europe.
Famous alumni include Nobel laureates: Albrecht Kossel, Karl von Frisch, and Otto Stern; theoretical physicists: Pascual Jordan and Walter H.

In Germany, there are only five universities that were founded before, while only Heidelberg and Leipzig operated continuously since then: Heidelberg (1386), Cologne (1388), Erfurt (1392/1994), Würzburg (1402/1582) and Leipzig (1409).
Throughout the 15th century, the University of Rostock had about 400 to 500 students each year, a large number at that time.
Rostock was among the largest universities in Germany at the time and many of its students also came from the Low Countries, Scandinavia or other states bordering the Baltic Sea.
In the course of political struggles and pressure from the church, the university moved to Greifswald in 1437 and remained there until 1443.
When the "ownership" of the university moved from the city to the state (Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin) in 1827, however, things changed for the better.
The end of the 19th century saw generous building activity in Rostock's alma mater and the university soon regained its old reputation amongst German universities.
1919–1945[edit]On the occasion of the 500th anniversary of the university, Albert Einstein and Max Planck received honorary doctorates on 12 November 1919.
This made the University of Rostock the world's first institute of higher learning to award this honour to Einstein.
Interestingly enough, the doctorate was not revoked during the Nazi rule in Germany (1933–1945), despite such orders by the Nazis.
The university, now finding itself in the Soviet Zone of Germany (the later German Democratic Republic), was re-opened on 24 February 1946.
The Faculty of Law was closed in 1951, aFaculty of Agriculturewas introduced in 1950 and in 1951 saw the opening of a Department of Shipbuilding (renamed Faculty of Technology in 1963).
In 1976 the university was renamed Wilhelm-Pieck-Universität after Wilhelm Pieck, the first president of the German Democratic Republic.
In 1978, the university engaged in a partnership with the Cochin University of Science and Technology (CUSAT), to help design the course structure and support the development of the Department of Ship Technology at CUSAT.
Also, a group of Rostock faculty members were sent to Cochin University of Science and Technology to improving the university's teaching facilities, remaining there until the late 1980s.
The prominent place of Cochin University of Science and Technology's Department of Ship Technology in the world maritime industry is thus largely credited to the extensive support of the University of Rostock.
1989–present[edit]The regional economy has improved as over 800 companies launched from the university since 1991.
External funding for research increased between 2005 and 2010 by 83% and currently is above 47 million Euros per year.
Over 500 million Euros has been invested in the university infrastructure since 1991, which will reach 750 million Euros by 2015.
The number of young people from the West Germany and international students who choose University of Rostock as a study location, are increasing every year.
In 2007, the University of Rostock gathered its research capacities into three profile lines: Life, Light & Matter (LLM), Maritime Systems, and Aging of Individuals and Society.
Life, Light & Matter develops new concepts for future technologies based on atomic and molecular processes in connection with laser optics and life sciences.
Maritime Systems unites oceanographers, engineers, humanities scholars, agricultural and social scientists, economists and lawyers.
Knowledge-Culture-Transformation deals with media and the representation of knowledge, transformation of knowledge, knowledge and interculturalism as well as knowledge and power.
The CWTS Leiden Ranking ranked University of Rostock as 327th in 2012, 379th in 2013, and 405th in 2014.
However, since 2010, QS World University Rankings has not listed University of Rostock within the top 500 universities.
Moreover, Times Higher Education World University Rankings has not listed University of Rostock within the top 400 universities since 2011.

According to a nationwide ranking survey conducted by the University of Munich, the University of Rostock is among the top-ten of most start-up friendly universities in Germany in 2009.
The study also suggests that University of Rostock performed well in the area of qualification and counselling of start-ups and in the field of coordination and mobilization of start-up potential.
Research[edit]In recent years, the University of Rostock has undergone significant conceptual and organisational changes, which included the bundling of competences and research activities in the interdisciplinary, cross-faculty departments of the Interdisciplinary Faculty.
Scientific priorities of the faculties have improved by including the interdisciplinary-based research units: Collaborative Research Centres, Research Training Groups, and Research Units.
The library possesses large special collections of culturally historical and scientifically historical old books.
In the Patents and Standards Centre (PNZ), all DIN norms and regulations as well as the VDI guidelines are provided.
Rostock Student Services[edit]The Rostock Student Services (German: Studentenwerk Rostock) provides accommodation for newly arrived international students who plan to study at the University of Rostock and the Rostock University of Music and Theatre.
International students, who have not lived or studied in Germany, are considered for a Starter Package service.
However, short-time students and students on a programme (ERASMUS; Sokrates) are given a low priority, while postgraduate students cannot use this service.

png The University of Freiburg (colloquially German: Uni Freiburg), officially the Albert Ludwig University of Freiburg (German: Albert-Ludwigs-Universität Freiburg), is a public research university located in Freiburg im Breisgau, Baden-Württemberg, Germany.
The university was founded in 1457 by the Habsburg dynasty as the second university in Austrian-Habsburg territory after the University of Vienna.
Today, Freiburg is the fifth-oldest university in Germany, with a long tradition of teaching the humanities, social sciences and natural sciences.
The university is made up of 11 faculties and attracts students from across Germany as well as from over 120 other countries.
Named as one of elite universities of Germany by academics, political representatives and the media, the University of Freiburg stands amongst Europe's top research and teaching institutions.
With its long-standing reputation of excellence, the university looks both to the past, to maintain its historic academic and cultural heritage, and to the future, developing new methods and opportunities to meet the needs of a changing world.
In addition, 19 Nobel laureates are affiliated with the University of Freiburg and 15 academics have been honored with the highest German research prize, the Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Prize, while working at the University of Freiburg.
Its establishment belongs to the second wave of German university foundings in the late Middle Ages, like the Eberhard Karls University of Tübingen and the University of Basel.
Established by papal privilege (papal bull), the University in Freiburg actually was - like all or most universities in the Middle Ages - a corporation of the church body and therefore belonged to the Roman Catholic Church and its hierarchy.
Also he declared Albrechts University as the "county university" (German Landesuniversität) for his territory until it was handed over to the Austrian House of Habsburg in 1490.
Freiburg around 1900The university soon attracted many students, such as the humanists Geiler von Kaysersberg, Johann Reuchlin, and Jakob Wimpfeling.
From around 1559 on, the university was housed at the Altes Collegium ("Old College"), today called the "new town-hall".
To counter reformatory tendencies, the administration of two faculties was handed over to the Roman Catholic order of the Jesuits in 1620.
From 1682 on, the Jesuits built their college, as well as the Jesuit church (nowadays the "University Church" or Universitätskirche).
Studium Gallicum[edit]In 1679, Freiburg temporarily became French territory, along with the southern parts of the upper Rhine.
Austrian reforms[edit]After Freiburg was re-conquered and appointed as capital of Further Austria, a new time began for the university by the reforms of Empress Maria Theresa of Austria.
The requirements for admission were changed for all faculties in 1767 (before that time only Roman Catholics were allowed to study) and Natural Sciences were added as well as Public Administration.
The Church finally lost its predominant influence on the university when the Jesuits were suppressed following a decree signed by Pope Clement XIV in 1773.
Consequently, Johann Georg Jacobi (brother of the more famous philosopher Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi) in 1784 was the first Protestant professor teaching at the university in Freiburg.
When Freiburg became a part of the newly established Grand Duchy of Baden (in German "Großherzogtum Baden") in 1805 (after Napoleon occupied the area of the formerly Further Austria), a crisis began for the university in Freiburg.
Albert Ludwigs University of Freiburg[edit]The university had enough endowments and earnings to survive until the beginning of the regency of Ludwig I, Grand Duke of Baden in 1818.
Since then, the university has been named Albert Ludwigs University of Freiburg (Albert-Ludwigs-Universität Freiburg) as an acknowledgement of gratitude by the university and the citizens of Freiburg.
Postage stamp by Deutsche Bundespost to commemorate the university's 500th anniversary in 1957In the 1880s, the population of the student body and faculty started to grow quickly.
The scientific reputation of Albert Ludwigs University attracted several researchers such as economist Adolph Wagner, historians Georg von Below and Friedrich Meinecke, and jurists Karl von Amira and Paul Lenel.
Kollegiengebäude I, erected in 1913 as the main building of the universityIn 1900, Freiburg became the first German university to accept female students.
In the beginning of the 20th century, several new university buildings were built in the centre of Freiburg, such as the new main building in 1911.
After WWI, the philosophers Edmund Husserl and Martin Heidegger (since 1928) taught at Albert Ludwigs University, as well as Edith Stein.
In the field of social sciences, Walter Eucken developed the idea of ordoliberalism, which subsequently is known as the "Freiburg School".
Third Reich[edit]During the Third Reich, the university went through the process of "political alignment" (Gleichschaltung) like the rest of the German universities.
Under the rector Martin Heidegger, all Jewish faculty members were forced to leave the university in accordance with the "Law for the Reintroduction of Professional Civil Service".
In the postwar years, the ideas of ordoliberalism, developed earlier by economists of the Freiburg School, such as Walter Eucken, Franz Böhm, Hans Grossmann-Doerth, and Leonhard Miksch, drove the creation of the German social market economy and its attendant Wirtschaftswunder.
Nobel Prize winner and former professor at the University of Freiburg, Friedrich Hayek, is also associated with this theory.
Arnold Bergstraesser, considered a founding father or German political science after World War II, was also a professor at the University of Freiburg.
His research group later formed what is now the Arnold Bergstraesser Institute for sociocultural research at the university.
In the 1970s, the faculty structure was changed to 14 departments, with the Faculty of Engineering becoming the 15th faculty in 1994.
The university opened a memorial dedicated to the victims of National Socialism among the students, staff, and faculty in 2003.
To the left and right of Christ are structures resembling towers, most likely symbolic of the Temple of Jerusalem.
The shield on the opposite side symbolizes the coat of arms used by the Habsburgs in conjunction with their territories.
Campus[edit] Aristotle, in front of the Kollegiengebäude IHaving grown with the city since the 15th century, the university's buildings are deeply intertwined with the city.
The three large campuses are the university center next to the historical city center, the institutes quarter, and the engineering campus, but other buildings can be found scattered throughout Freiburg.
The university complex in the historical center of Freiburg contains such picturesque buildings as the Jugendstil Kollegiengebäude I, built in 1911 by Hermann  The Department of Surgery at the University Medical CenterBilling, and the gothic revival old university library.
The current University Library is also located in the historical center; it is a monumental building erected in the 1970s, and was to be renovated and redesigned beginning in September, 2008.
It is one of the largest in Germany and placed fourth in an October, 2007, German national ranking of university libraries.
The church and the Jesuit college were handed over to the university after the Jesuit order was suppressed in 1773.
Today, the quarter houses the physics buildings, the tall main chemistry building, visible from afar, the famous Institute for Macromolecular Chemistry at the Hermann-Staudinger-Haus, various other science buildings, and the renowned preclinical institutes of the Faculty of Medicine.
The University Library in FreiburgThe engineering campus is located next to the small Freiburg airfield to the northwest of the city center, close to the University Medical Center.
The campus is home to the Institut für Mikrosystemtechnik ( Department of Microsystems Engineering) and the Department of Computer Science.
With the addition of the Faculty of Engineering, the University of Freiburg became the first classical university to combine traditional disciplines with microsystems technologies.
It boasts 1,600 beds and handles 55,000 in-patients a year, with another 357,000 being treated as out-patients.
The University Medical Center achieved many technical advances, such as the first implantation of an artificial heart Jarvik 2000 in 2002.
Most recently, the University of Freiburg purchased a large historic villa in the district of Herdern, which will house part of the literature and linguistics, as well as history departments of the Freiburg Institute for Advanced Studies.
In 2015, the University of Freiburg opened its new library, housed in a modern building with a large glass and chrome facade.
The library features a section for quiet work and the permanent collection as well as space for group work, where collaboration is encouraged.
Students and admission[edit] Kollegiengebäude IV, Humanities Faculty (former University Library)The university has a combined undergraduate and graduate student population of around 21,600.
Admission largely depends on the faculty and program applied for and is strictly merit based, with the average score of final secondary-school examinations (German Abitur) or A-levels playing an important role.
The University of Freiburg offers a large variety of undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral degree programs at its 11 faculties in 150 fields of study.
However, lectures and classes usually do not run for the full duration of these periods and allow for breaks in spring and fall.
However, the University of Freiburg does charge a 210 EUR fee per year for all undergraduate and most graduate and doctoral programs, regardless of the EU or non-EU citizenship of students.
Student life[edit]Numerous student clubs and organizations are active, among them a campus radio station, echo-fm, and a student television station, alma*, which is also available as a podcast.
Because of the nearby French and Swiss borders and the adjacent Black Forest, where the university owns a retreat on Schauinsland Mountain, fine opportunities exist for leisure and outdoor activities.
Students come from Central and Eastern Europe for language studies, the majority demographic category is females in age range 18-25 (58%).
Additionally, further dormitories in Freiburg are operated by other institutions, such as the Catholic Archdiocese or the Evangelical Church.
However, the popularity of Freiburg for prospective students can make finding an apartment or room quite time-consuming, especially before the start of the academic terms.
The university has its own career center, singled out as one of the best in Germany by the Stifterverband für die Deutsche Wissenschaft.

de The Katholische Universität Eichstätt-Ingolstadt is a Roman Catholic university in Eichstätt and Ingolstadt, Bavaria, Germany.
University of Heidelberg) it is a rather small institution (with 4,800 students in summer 2005); nevertheless, it is the largest private university in Germany.
The university has one campus in Eichstätt situated in the Altmühltal Nature Park and another campus in Ingolstadt, one of Germany's economically most successful cities.
The latter institution was moved to the capital Munich – nowadays the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München (LMU) by King Ludwig I in 1826.
Today's university came into existence through a fusion of Eichstätt's School of Education and the School of Philosophy and Theology in 1980.
A major role in the formation of the university was played by the former archbishop of Munich-Freising, Joseph Kardinal Ratzinger (now Pope Benedict XVI ), who later got an honorary doctorate from the university.
Among others receiving honorary doctorates from the university are the philosopher Karl Popper, and the former bishop of Eichstätt Alois Brems.
In 1990, the Catholic University established the WFI - Ingolstadt School of Management, one of Germany's foremost business schools.
Since 1998 the Collegium Orientale, an academic institution associated with the university, hosts young theologians and priests from eastern European and Oriental churches who continue their post-graduate studies in Eichstätt.
The ethos of Catholic universities was defined in Pope John Paul II's Apostolic Constitution of Catholic Churches.
The CU at a glance[edit]The 8 faculties of the Catholic University of Eichstätt-Ingolstadt offer 40 different subjects.
The CU is fully accredited by the Free State of Bavaria, and is thus equated to German state universities in all respects.
5 million volumes, thus offering students and teaching staff immediate access to books of all areas via an electronic inventory accessible from almost anywhere.
[citation needed] In subsequent years the CU received high rankings for the learning environment it offers to its students.
Especially, the Faculty of Business in Ingolstadt was and continues to be one of the most competitive business schools in Germany.
[citation needed] In 2005, the CU's journalism program was ranked among the five best media and communication programs in Germany.
[citation needed]The portion of international students from Europe and all over the world is very high compared to state universities.
Russian, Spanish, French and English are thus very common languages in Eichstätt, many students being fluent in at least 2 of them.
One of the biggest changes currently affecting the CU is the shift from the old German academic system to the new European bachelor's and master's degrees based on credit points by 2010.
This change should help to allow students to spend time abroad easily, and transfer their grades easily for their degrees at the CU.
In addition, more and more BA and MA integrated degrees are being offered, where the students spend only part of their time at the CU, the rest at one of the partner universities.
These double or triple degrees offer a possibility to experience the academic environment of more than one country, and are an increasingly popular choice for freshmen at the CU.
This is about one quarter of the 300,000 volumes of philosophy and theology donated for the purpose of being included in university library's collections.
An inquest ordered by the Government of the Free State of Bavaria concluded that no valuable books had been destroyed.
Central Library of the Catholic University of Eichstätt-IngolstadtCampus[edit]The Main Campus is situated in Eichstätt, the university buildings being within walking distance (about 10 minutes) from the town center.

Some faculty buildings are part of the New Palace of Sanssouci which is known for its UNESCO World Heritage status.
The University of Potsdam is Brandenburg's largest university and the fourth largest in the Berlin-Brandenburg metropolitan area which is well known as one of the reputable education and research locations in Germany and Europe.
In 2009 the University of Potsdam became a winner in the "Excellence in Teaching" initiative of the Stifterverband für die Deutsche Wissenschaft (Business innovation agency for the German science system).
3 International doctoral studies5 See also6 Notes7 References8 External linksHistory[edit]The University of Potsdam was formed in 1991 by the amalgamation of the Karl Liebknecht College of Education and the Brandenburg State College, as well as several other smaller institutions.
As the university in large part emerged from the College of Education, emphasis today is still placed on teacher training.
Historical buildings[edit]  Babelsberg campus – House 1Some parts of the university are located in historical buildings that have been named as World Heritage Sites by UNESCO.
The university library and the Institute of History can be found in a part of the commons in the park of Sanssouci, at the New Palace, as can the Institute of Mathematics in the former stables.
The oldest buildings of the Golm campus were built in the 1930s to house the Luftwaffe's intelligence department.
The current Faculty of Law is located in Babelsberg/Griebnitzsee in the former presidial and administrative buildings of the German Red Cross (1939/40).
Other lecture halls and buildings were built in the 1950s directly behind the Schloss Babelsberg for the Academy of Justice and the East German state.
The university's main campus, which includes the Auditorium Maximum, is situated in the immediate proximity of Park Sanssouci.
The Communs – the prestigious annexes of the New Palace are home to some of the institutes of the Faculty of Arts.
The eighteenth century baroque buildings, which disguise their former purpose as the Palace's offices and service rooms with staircases, porticos, cupolas, and rich ornamentation, are currently home to the university's presidential office and administration.
The Institutes of Sports Science and Sports Medicine as well as the Institute for Mathematics can be found on the Campus Am Neuen Palais.
Most institutes of the Faculty of Science as well as the Human Sciences Faculty are located in Potsdam-Golm, where state-of-the-art research facilities and architecturally intriguing buildings form one of the largest science parks in the region.
Three Max Planck Institutes and two Fraunhofer Institutes as well as the start-up center GO:IN have already settled here.
Babelsberg[edit]Potsdam-Babelsberg/Griebnitzsee: Faculties of Law, Economics and Social Studies, Institutes of Computer Science, the Hasso Plattner Institute for Software Systems Engineering.
Campus Griebnitzsee is situated along the city border with Berlin, not far from the famous Babelsberg film studios, and houses the Law Faculty and the Faculty of Economics and Social Sciences.
The Institute of Computer Sciences is also located here and benefits greatly from its proximity to the Hasso Plattner Institute for Software Systems Engineering, a completely privately funded co-institute of the University of Potsdam.
Academic profile[edit]At the beginning of the winter semester of the 2008/2009 academic year, roughly 20,000 young people were studying at the University of Potsdam.
The largest number of students were enrolled at the Faculty of Philosophy, 5,934 (30%), with 5,324 (27%) at the Faculty of Mathematics and Science.
26% of the freshers come from East Germany, 14% from the West and 14% from Berlin, evaluated by the place where they obtained their entry requirements.
With interdisciplinary research agenda, the area of excellence links the departments of Psychology, Linguistics, and Sports and Health Science.
UP offers more than 100 degree programs in various fields, offered in German as well as other languages, notably French and English.
Faculties[edit]  AudiMax (auditorium maximum) of the Potsdam UniversityAs is common in Germany, the University of Potsdam's teaching and research programmes are carried out along the lines of faculties.
The university contains the following faculties:Faculty of Law[edit]The Law Faculty's curriculum offers the basic and required courses necessary to become a fully qualified lawyer.
At Potsdam, the areas of concentration in research and teaching comprise the fundamentals of law, civil judicature, business law, international law, public administration as well as business, tax, and environmental criminal law.
Additional events for training and continuing education for practitioners in the municipal realm are offered by the Institute for Local Government Studies and in international relations by the Human Rights Centre.
Furthermore, a German-French law program exists in cooperation with University Paris Ouest-Nanterre/La Défense.
Faculty of Philosophy[edit]In recent years, the University of Potsdam's Philosophical Faculty has redefined itself in the spirit of cross-disciplinary cultural studies.
Drawing from the broad range of faculty specialties, the thematic concentrations of "Cultures in/of Mobility," "Forms of Life and the Know How of Living" as well as "Region and Identity in Europe" were created.
This emphasis in regard to content encourages interdisciplinary cooperation, but it also incorporates perspectives that are outside the Philosophical Faculty's traditional subject canon.
The Focus Area Unsettled Cultures, for example, investigates among others the history and cultural practice of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam and thereby combines different areas of study, such as theology, literature, ethics, medicine, and cosmology.
In the spirit of research-based teaching, new academic programs such as Mobility Studies are being developed to complement the already existing interdisciplinary Master's programs in Jewish Studies, Communications Linguistics, Military Studies, European Media Studies as well as others.
The graduate colleges, graduate schools, and externally funded projects under the auspices of the Philosophical Faculty offer young scholars the opportunity for interdisciplinary and international cooperation.
Faculty of Human Science[edit]With the Cognitive Sciences and the Educational Sciences, the Faculty of Human Sciences includes two of the interdisciplinary focus areas of the University of Potsdam that operate beyond faculty boundaries.
The Cognitive Sciences' excellence is based predominantly on the Collaborative Research Centre "Information Structure: The Linguistic Means for Structuring Utterances, Sentences and Texts.
" Empirical research is currently being expanded in the educational sciences, and it is closely linked to teaching.
In the education and training of aspiring teachers in all faculties, the Faculty of Human Sciences occupies a central role.
The "Area of Excellence Cognitive Sciences" and the "Focus Area Educational Sciences" are divided into further research clusters and teaching units.
Instruction in the departments of psychology, linguistics, sports, and health science is organized into educational science and teacher training.
The research emphases are language, action and behavior, health, professional and popular sports, school and classroom as well as teaching across the life span.
In the future, the existing potentials in the area of health sciences and prevention will be developed into another focus area.
The research area in health is currently already well connected with the support systems for professional sports.
The university clinic is currently licensed as an examination center of the German Olympic Sports Confederation.
Furthermore, the faculty is actively striving for more quality in training students by establishing national and international Master's and graduate programs and by developing a system of quality assurance in teaching.
The faculty is considered one of the most important German institutes for research, training, and consulting in the areas of policy research and administrative sciences.
Following a multi-theoretical approach, researchers are investigating the interactive relationship between politics, economy, and institutions at different levels and in different fields of activity.
The interdisciplinary approach allows for a study of the interplay between the economy, public and private institutions, and policy-making.
Problems of governance between state, economy, and civil society are just as much a concern as problems of governance within the very differentiated public sector.
The interplay of different research approaches and methods creates empirical and theoretical knowledge that transmits a complex and differentiated picture of socioeconomic, cultural, and political developmental processes in modern societies—domestically as well as internationally.
Therefore, the outcomes of research in the areas start-up, consulting, and innovation directly benefit the faculty's Institute for Start-up and Innovation (BIEM CEIP), a central service institution for aspiring entrepreneurs.
The Institute for Local Government Studies (KWI) conducts collaborative research with the Law Faculty in examining issues faced by municipalities in the new Länder and offers continuing education to its elected officials.
Furthermore, the faculty's Potsdam Center for Public Policy and Management (PCPM) ensures active national and international knowledge transfer with its research and consulting projects as well as opportunities for academically-focused continuing education.
Especially the study programs in Geoecology, Geoscience, Nutrition Science, Polymer Science, and Software Systems Engineering are in high demand.
The faculty has been strong in gaining external funding and has established future-oriented concentrations and productive core areas in research and teaching.
Five of the university's eight focus areas are part of the Faculty of Science: Earth Sciences, Functional Soft Matter, Functional Ecology and Evolution, Complex Systems, and Plant Genomics/Systems Biology.
The faculty's own concentrations, such as teacher training in mathematics and natural sciences, sensibly complement the focus areas by supporting their interconnectedness and contribute to their continuous advancement and renewal.
The close cooperation between the natural sciences and extramural research institutions in the Berlin-Brandenburg region, already intended in the University of Potsdam's founding concept, was praised very early on by the German Council of Science and Humanities.
The collaboration with several institutes of the Max Planck Society, the Fraunhofer Gesellschaft, the Helmholtz Association, the Leibniz Association, and the Hasso Plattner Institute for Software Systems Engineering exemplify this extensive networking.
Notable research centres and institutes[edit]Within faculties, teaching and research activities may be further decentralised through departments, graduate schools or institutes.
For example,•PCPM, Potsdam Center for Policy and Management, which has earned the University of Potsdam a reputation as one of the leading competence centers for Governance and the Public Sector.
A recent reputation study by the German Association for Political Science has declared the University of Potsdam one of the three most important German universities and research institutions in the area of policy research and administrative sciences.
Hasso Plattner, co-founder and advisory board chairman of the software company SAP, created the opportunity for a unique academic elite-education in IT systems technology.
Meeting the demands of the industry, about a dozen professors and more than fifty additional visiting professors and lecturers are currently training about 450 highly talented young people in the Bachelor and Master's programs to become IT systems engineers.
•The Hasso Plattner Institute of Design integrates product design, engineering, and business management education, in cooperation with Stanford University.
While it is located in Stanford University, it is a joint project and a degree with respective content is also offered through the Hasso Plattner Institute in Potsdam.
When the Nazis closed the Higher Institute for Jewish Studies (Hochschule für die Wissenschaft des Judentums) in Berlin in 1942, it meant the end of an era that had begun with Abraham Geiger.
In 1836 Geiger had called for the founding of a Jewish theological department at a German university that would be dedicated to Jewish tradition in the spirit of academic freedom.
Today, the Abraham Geiger College provides education for rabbis and cantors for Jewish communities in Central and Eastern Europe.
Besides vocational training, participants go through a regular university program of study that is integrated into the extensive curriculum of the School of Jewish Theology at the University of Potsdam and that must be completed with a B.
After completing the degree and contingent upon agreement of supervisors and mentors, the rabbinical college then recommends candidates for ordination into the Jewish clergy.
•The Moses Mendelssohn Center for European-Jewish Studies focuses on the history, religion, and culture of Jews and Judaism in European countries.
On the one hand, research is concerned with the problems of social integration and acculturation faced by Jews, and on the other hand it focuses on comparative social historical questions related to living conditions and to geographical as well as social mobility.
Much attention is also given to sociocultural and intellectual-historical aspects, such as literature, art, religion, philosophy, and music.
The Moses Mendelssohn Center owns an extensive and publicly accessible specialized library that currently holds around 50,000 volumes.
•The Potsdam Graduate School, which sees its primary task in the promotion of already accredited doctoral candidates and post-doctorals as well as in the continuous optimization of doctoral conditions and quality management.
The Potsdam Graduate School stands for transparency within doctoral procedures and the intensification and improvement of doctoral supervision.
Supportive institutions[edit]•The Language Centre offers students of all faculties the chance to learn many languages at various levels of proficiency, and holds a collegial certificate of international accreditation from UNIcert.
•Sports center•Computing center•AStA – Students' union executive committee•International Relations Office•Studentenwerk Potsdam•University LibraryTuition fees and scholarships[edit]Tuition fees at University of Potsdam vary, depending on nationality and programme of study.
For German and EU/EEA students there is currently no tuition fee, however, several additional fees such as for the students union as well as mandatory public transportation tickets for students have to be paid.
For both EU/EEA students as well as non-EU/EEA students a variety of financial assistance and scholarships is available.
Among others, the German Academic Exchange Service (Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst – DAAD) offers a very extensive scholarship programme.
Students or post-graduates can apply for a wide variety of scholarships, but the conditions and opportunities vary according to the country of origin and field of study.
Other scholarship providers also have varying prerequisites regarding country of origin, field of study, prior academic performance, the duration of the scholarship, etc.
The prerequisites and the weighting of the various criteria for stipends are determined by the individual profiles of the foundation providing for the scholarships.
For some foundations, previous marks are weighted as the main criteria, and the social situation of the applicant is given significantly less weight.
For other scholarships, good marks are important in order to receive a scholarship, but this does not mean that an applicant qualifies for one.
Many foundations give significant weight to financial need, engagement in the civil society, or a developed personal profile.
Close cooperation and joint professorships also exist with the Max Planck Institute for Molecular Plant Physiology, the Max Planck Institute of Colloids and Interfaces, the Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics, and many other research institutions.
Last but not least, the university collaborates with both institutes of the Fraunhofer Gesellschaft in the Science Park Potsdam-Golm, a research campus that is growing in significance far beyond Germany's borders.
Similarly, the Hasso Plattner Institute of University of Potsdam in cooperation with Stanford University offers a design school based in Stanford University, the Hasso Plattner Institute of Design.
While it is located at Stanford University, various partnerships as well as a degree is offered through University of Potsdam.
The university offers a number of German courses, organizes intercultural training workshops, and matches up tandem-partners who want to learn one another's language.
International partnerships offer opportunities to spend one semester or a full year at one of many partner universities.
Jewish studies in Israel, sports management in Australia, language and politics in Moscow, or an excursion to Montana to visit the geographical center of the earth – the choice among about 300 partnerships is great.
Potsdam is a popular choices both for the Erasmus and Tempus as well as for the Fulbright program and the international programs of the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD).
An institution at Potsdam's Law Faculty that is unique in Germany is the German-French law program, which is operated in cooperation with the partner University Paris Ouest-Nanterre/La Défense.
At the University of Potsdam students can participate not just in an exchange program, but they also have the opportunity in their first two years in the standard German law program to complete an additional, self-contained program of study in French law.
This French part of the program is taught by French visiting scholars from the partner university and is conducted in French.
These are programmes of study in which all courses and coursework is carried out in English:•Executive Master of Public Management (EMPM)•Master of Public Management (MPM)•Anglophone Modernities in Literature and Culture (M.
)•European Master in Clinical Linguistics (EMCL)•Master in Polymer Science•Master in National and International Administration (MANIA)•International M.
Program Clinical Exercise Science (CES)Executive Master Programs[edit]Several executive masters are offered and have reached a high popularity, offered entirely or partly in English.
Doctoral students in Germany generally pursue their doctorates in the context of individual research projects, rather than in structured programmes as in many other countries.
Upon completion of a dissertation project, one receives a doctoral degree for individual scholarly achievements.
The prerequisite for doctoral studies is an above average graduate degree, Master's of Arts, Master's of Science, Diploma, Staatsexamen or another equivalent degree.
The doctoral examination board (Promotionsausschuss) of your institute of interest, or the Dean of the Law Faculty respectively, is responsible for determining questions of equivalency.
After submitting a dissertation and receiving a positive assessment, doctoral students are required to take part in a disputation.

The eruption of the Indonesian volcano Mount Tambora in 1815 triggered a global climate change and was one of the causes of the massive famine suffered in the Kingdom of Württemberg at the beginning of the 19th century.
King William I of Württemberg set up an Agricultural Academy in Hohenheim to radically improve general nutrition in the kingdom through teaching, experimentation and demonstration in 1818 and, in so doing, laid the foundation for the University of Hohenheim.
It is not connected to or affiliated with the University of Stuttgart (founded in 1829), although there is collaboration between the two.
The first director of the academy was Johann Nepomuk Schwerz, and it was located in Hohenheim Palace, built by Charles Eugene, Duke of Württemberg.
By appointing Margarete von Wrangell to the chair for plant nutrition in 1923, she became the first female full professor at a German university.
During the period of national socialism, the university was brought into line with the party’s ideology and in 1945 it was forced to close.
Architecturally, the university that re-opened its doors in 1946 had survived World War II relatively undamaged.
In 1964 the faculties of Agricultural Sciences and Natural Sciences were created, followed in 1968 by the Faculty of Business, Economics and Social Sciences.
Today there are approximately 9,000 students and a teaching staff of around 900, of which slightly more than 100 are professors.
Location[edit]The University of Hohenheim is located in southwest Germany, in the district of Plieningen on the southern rim of Baden- Württemberg’s capital Stuttgart.
It was named the most beautiful campus university in Baden-Württemberg in 2009 and is generally acknowledged as having one of the most picturesque campuses in the country.
The baroque palace, the University's emblem and its main building, is surrounded by historic parklands and botanical gardens, including the historic Landesarboretum Baden-Württemberg.
The campus is close to the light rail line U3 station Plieningen Garbe (Stuttgart Stadtbahn) and is within minutes from Stuttgart airport, Stuttgart Exhibition Center and major motorways.
)[edit]•Agricultural SciencesResearch[edit]The university currently pursues research in the fields of health, nutrition, agriculture, consumer protection and environmental protection, as well as economics and communication.
ELLS[edit]The University of Hohenheim was co-founder of the Euroleague for Life Sciences (ELLS) which was established in 2001.
Its goal is to offer dual degree programs in Management on all academic levels: Bachelor's, Master's and Doctoral studies.
The participating universities work closely together in defining their study programs, exchanging professors and organizing joint research projects.
Each year, this network holds an annual conference at one of the partner universities, where common programs are defined and achievements are reported.
Visitors can take a tour through the history of agriculture in the German Agricultural Museum, which encompasses 5,700 sq.
The Zoological and Veterinary Museum has a collection of teaching aids and curiosities on display in a traditional exhibition in the palace.
Set in the Exotic Garden of the university, the Hohenheim History Museum in the Spielhaus tells the history of the municipality, the palace and the university.
Special characteristics[edit]•The University of Hohenheim has been accredited as being a family-oriented university since 2004.
•According to a survey conducted to elect the most beautiful campus in Germany, the university could reach the 7th place in the overall placings in 2009.

It is one of the top nine leading technical universities in Germany (TU9) with highly ranked programs in civil, mechanical, industrial and electrical engineering.
The University of Stuttgart is especially known for its excellent reputation in the fields of advanced automotive engineering, efficient industrial and automated manufacturing, process engineering, aerospace engineering and activity-based costing.
The academic tradition of the University of Stuttgart goes back to its probably most famous graduate student: Gottlieb Daimler, the Inventor of the automobile.
Along with the Technical University of Munich, the Technical University of Darmstadt and Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, it represents one of the four members of the South German Axis of Advanced Engineering and Management.
These four universities, in combination with RWTH Aachen are the top five universities of the aforementioned TU9.
Located in Stuttgart-Hohenheim, it has since 1818 been the University of Hohenheim and is not related to the University of Stuttgart, except for some joint activities.
Because of the increasing importance of the technical sciences and instruction in these fields, from 1876 the university was known as the Technical College.
The development of the courses of study at the Technical College of Stuttgart led to its renaming in 1967 to the present-day "Universität Stuttgart".
With this change of name came along a built-up of new fields, such as history of science and technology and the social sciences, and the extension of existing ones, such as history and art history.
) are located in Vaihingen, while the humanities, the social sciences, architecture, and similar topics are still located in the city center campus.
As of 2014, University of Stuttgart is ranked 85th in the world in the field of Engineering & Technology according to QS World University Rankings.
University of Stuttgart is one of the best universities in the fields of mechanical, aeronautical, and manufacturing engineering (48th worldwide and 3rd best in Germany) and has been ranked several times as one of the best engineering universities in Germany.

svg Data as of September 2015 The University of Regensburg (German: Universität Regensburg) is a public research university located in the medieval city of Regensburg, Bavaria, a city that is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
The university was founded on July 18, 1962 by the Landtag of Bavaria as the fourth full-fledged university in Bavaria.
Following groundbreaking in 1965, the university officially opened to students during the 1967–1968 winter semester, initially housing faculties in Law and Business Sciences and Philosophy.
The university actively participates in the European Union's SOCRATES programme as well as several TEMPUS programmes.
Its most famous academic, the previous Pope Benedict XVI, served as a professor there until 1977 and formally retains his chair in theology.
In 1487, Duke Albrecht IV of Bavaria and the Regensburg city council sent a petition to Pope Innocent VIII to establish a university within the city.
In 1562, Croatian Protestant reformer Matthias Flacius again advocated the creation of a university in the city, arguing that a university in Regensburg would spread the ideas of the Protestant Reformation to Slavic lands.
Protestant intellectuals again tried to establish a university in 1633, though their attempts were blocked by the arrival of imperial troops from orders of Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand II.
Following the end of the Second World War, a group of concerned intellectuals and academics in Eastern Bavaria established the Association of the Friends of the University (Verein der Freunde der Universität Regensburg e.
The association's advocacy proved successful in 1962 when the Bavarian Landtag authorized the creation of the university.
The first lectures began during the 1967 winter semester, with the faculties of Law and Business Sciences and Philosophy as the first schools for students.
Since 1967, the university has expanded to twelve faculties, including medicine, biology, psychology, and chemistry.
The German Research Association has deeply supported a number of research projects in the university, including the fields of biochemistry and microbiology.
The university's most famous faculty member is Pope Benedict XVI, who taught from 1969 until he was appointed Cardinal and Archbishop of Munich in 1977.
In 2006, one year following his election to the papacy, Benedict XVI returned to the University of Regensburg to make a highly controversial lecture that garnered the university international attention.
Another famous former faculty member, Karl Stetter, worked as head of the Archaea Center and the Department of Microbiology between 1980 and 2002.
Among his discoveries were Pyrococcus furiosus in 1986, Aquifex aeolicus, Aquifex pyrophilus, and Nanoarchaeum equitans, discovered in 2002.
Location and staff[edit]Situated entirely on one central campus, the university is located south of Regensburg's inner city on a small incline south of the Danube River, and directly adjacent to the Regensburg University of Applied Sciences and the A 3 autobahn.
Including the affiliated university hospital, the University of Regensburg has approximately 4,200 employees including 312 professors, and teaches more than 20,000 students (summer term 2015).
The university's reputation and attractiveness is enhanced by the 2,000-year-old town of Regensburg, its scenic countryside, the Donautal (Danube Valley), a high density of bars and the nearby heights of the Bavarian Forest.
Brisk cultural life both in the city and on campus provide great recreational opportunities, enhanced by a number of nearby lakes.
Moreover: preceding to the necessary measures the existing university could simply get an additional Technical Faculty as some universities in Bavaria have, e.
In any case, the addition of such a faculty would also make sense for the Regensburg university, since in the city and its surroundings there exists a lot of engineering industry.
The university was one of the first German universities to introduce modularized study programs following the Bologna model.
Cross-disciplinary co-operation, the strengthening of key competences, project orientation, and a flexible study programme are the hallmarks of these new degree programmes, preparing students for many modern career options.
All students, irrespective of their specialisation, are offered a number of programmes which can be taken to complement their main field of study.
Research[edit]Key fields of activity include the Natural Sciences (Physics, Bio-Sciences, Chemistry and Pharmacy), the Humanities (History, Philologies) and Medicine.
The German Research Association (DFG) currently sponsors two collaborative research centres, four research units and five interdisciplinary graduate colleges.
In detail: according to a recent documentation of the DFG, the physics faculty of the university in 2009 held the first place in Bavaria, and the third one in Germany, concerning the financial support.
Moreover, the high-energy physicists of the faculty form the center of a large international cooperation on a basic theory in the field, the Quantum Chromodynamics, with a large special computer, called QPACE.
Due to its geographical location near the former Iron Curtain border of the Czech Republic, the university considers itself a bridge between East and West.
Working with partners in Europaeum, the University of Regensburg has set up an interdisciplinary centre for research and teaching on all aspects pertaining to Central, Eastern and Southeastern European countries.
As part of the focus on Eastern Europe the University of Regensburg offers degrees like Suutheastern-European Studies and Eastern European studies.
The university is also home for the Bavarian University Centre for Central, East and Southeastern Europe (BAYHOST) which works on deepening cooperation between universities of the region and the state of Bavaria.
The university closely cooperates with other institutions focusing on Eastern Europe in the city like the Institute for Eastern and Southeastern European studies, the Ostrecht institute (institute for Easteuropean legal studies)and the Hungarian institute among others.
Service[edit]On campus, students are provided with a large central cafeteria (Mensa) and several smaller ones, a pizzeria, a bank, a bookshop as well as various other shops.
The university has been adapted to the needs of the disabled as far as possible and accommodation of the same standard is available.
All students receive a PIN code for the computers, which grants free access to e-mail services and the Internet in all computer rooms throughout the campus.
Students also have access to the services provided by the University’s Computer Centre in any one of the more than 20 computer pools on campus and in most of the student dormitories.
Student residences, a number of which cater to students with special needs, are located in close proximity to the campus as well as in the city centre itself.
In addition to its academic function, the University of Regensburg encourages numerous extracurricular activities on campus.
Various choirs, musical ensembles and art exhibitions (drawings, prints, sculpture and photography) testify to a dynamic cultural life on campus.
The University’s International Office offers international students well developed orientation and integration programmes.
Points of interest[edit]•Botanischer Garten der Universität Regensburg, the university's botanical gardenPartner Universities[edit]The university currently maintains links with over 130 European academic institutions.
The number of partner universities in countries of Central and Eastern Europe, Cyprus and the Baltic States has steadily grown ever since the initiation of the programme for associated countries.
Favourite destinations for students are and have always been Great Britain, followed by France, Italy and Spain.
Universities of Kanazawa, Japan and Korea University, Seoul provide opportunities for Regensburg students to partake in teaching programs in English language and, depending on their level of language training, as teachers themselves.
Two Latin American universities, the Universidad de los Andes, Mérida, Venezuela, and the Universidad de Guanajuato, Mexico, provide several university places.

Elector John Frederick of Saxony first thought of a plan to establish a university at Jena upon Saale in 1547 while he was being held captive by emperor Charles V.
The plan was put into motion by his three sons and, after having obtained a charter from the Emperor Ferdinand I, the university was established on 2 February 1558.
The university, jointly maintained by the Saxon Duchies who derived from partitioning of John Frederick's duchy, was thus named Ducal Pan-Saxon University (German: Herzoglich Sächsische Gesamtuniversität) or Salana (after the river Saale).
The university's reputation peaked under the auspices of Duke Charles Augustus, Goethe's patron (1787–1806), when Gottlieb Fichte, G.
Founded as a home for the new religious opinions of the sixteenth century, it has since been one of the most politically radical universities in Germany.
Jena was noted among other German universities at the time for allowing students to duel and to have a passion for Freiheit, which were popularly regarded as the necessary characteristics of German student life.
The University of Jena has preserved a historical detention room or Karzer with famous caricatures by Swiss painter Martin Disteli.
In the latter 19th century, the department of zoology taught evolutionary theory, with Carl Gegenbaur, Ernst Haeckel and others publishing detailed theories at the time of Darwin's "Origin of Species" (1858).
The later fame of Ernst Haeckel eclipsed Darwin in some European countries, as the term "Haeckelism" was more common than Darwinism.
Amongst its numerous auxiliaries then were the library, with 200,000 volumes; the observatory; the meteorological institute; the botanical garden; the seminaries of theology, philology, and education; and the well-equipped clinical, anatomical, and physical institutes.
After the end of the Saxon duchies in 1918, and their merger with further principalities into the Free State of Thuringia in 1920, the university was renamed as the Thuringian State University (Thüringische Landesuniversität) in 1921.
During the 20th century, the cooperation between Zeiss corporation and the university brought new prosperity and attention to Jena, resulting in a dramatic increase in funding and enrollment.
Nazi period[edit]Main article: University education in Nazi GermanyDuring the Third Reich, staunch Nazis moved into leading position at the university.
The racial researcher and SS-Hauptscharführer Karl Astel was appointed professor in 1933, bypassing traditional qualifications and process; he later became rector of the University in 1939.
Also in 1933, many professors had to leave the university as a consequence of the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service.
Student fraternities - in particular the Burschenschaften - were dissolved and incorporated into the Nazi student federation.
The Nazi student federation enjoyed before the transfer of power and won great support among the student body elections in January 1933, achieving 49.
When the Allied air raids to Jena in February and March struck in 1945, the University Library, the University main building and several clinics in the Bachstraße received total or significant physical damage.
Completely destroyed were the Botanical Garden, the psychological and the physiological institute and three chemical Institutes.
A Senate Commission noted the participation of the physician to the "euthanasia" murders of physically or mentally disabled children.
Present[edit]In the 20th century the university was promoted through cooperation with Carl Zeiss (company) and also became thereby a mass university.
In 1905 the university had 1,100 students and 112 university teachers, so this figure has since been almost twenty-fold.
Since 1995, there is a university association with the Martin Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg and the University of Leipzig.
The aim is firstly to give the students the opportunity to visit with relatively few problems at the partner universities and events in order to broaden the range of subjects and topics.
In addition, the cooperation provides the university management the opportunity to share experiences with their regular meetings and initiate common projects.
went from the successful bid to the German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research (iDiv) from the University network.
The co-operation continues at other levels: for example in a joint mentoring program for female postdocs or in the central German archives network.
Since October 2014, the pharmacologist Walter Rosenthal is the president of the University; Chancellor is since 2007 the mathematician Klaus Bartholmé.
Research[edit]Research at Friedrich Schiller University traditionally focusses on both humanities and sciences.
In 2007 the graduate school "Jena School for Microbial Communication" (JSMC) was established within the German Universities Excellence Initiative.
In 2008 the Center for Molecular Biomedicine (CMB) and the interdisciplinary research center Laboratory of the Enlightenment were developed as research institutions.
Jena University is one of the founder of The German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research (iDiv) Halle-Jena-Leipzig, that was founded in 2013.
Friedrich Schiller University is the only German University with a chair for gravitational theory and one for Caucasus Studies.
The Schiller Gardenhouse and the Goethe Memorial at the Botanical Garden are reminders of the two towering geniuses of Jena.

Although the permission of the pope was granted in 1564 and of the emperor in 1566, the university was founded about ninety years later in 1654, after the acquisition of the duchy of Kleve by Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg.
During its period of activity it was one of the central and leading universities of the western provinces of Prussia.
Since only about one third of the population in the western provinces of Prussia were member of the reformed church, most Lutheran and Catholic citizens in the second half of the 18th century, sent their sons to other universities.
Large parts of the Duisburg University Library were relocated to Bonn and then formed the basis of the newly formed Bonn Library.
Also the sceptre of the University of Duisburg was given to the University of Bonn, and is available until today.
In 1891 the Rheinisch-Westfälische Hüttenschule was settled from Bochum to Duisburg, which was later developed to the Königlich-Preußischen Maschinenbau- und Hüttenschule, and was renamed in 1938 to Public School of Engineering.
After a decision of the federal state government in 1960 the teacher training college of Kettwig was settled to Duisburg and was named Pedagogical University Ruhr.
In 1968, the university was founded again in Duisburg, related to the old one, bearing the name: Comprehensive University of Duisburg.

Leipzig University (German: Universität Leipzig), in Leipzig in the Free State of Saxony, Germany, is one of the world's oldest universities and the second-oldest university (by consecutive years of existence) in Germany.
Famous alumni include Leibniz, Goethe, Ranke, Nietzsche, Wagner, Angela Merkel, Raila Odinga, Tycho Brahe, and nine Nobel laureates are associated with the university.
The university was founded on December 2, 1409 by Frederick I, Elector of Saxony and his brother William II, Margrave of Meissen, and originally comprised the four scholastic faculties.
Since its inception, the university has engaged in teaching and research for over 600 years without interruption.

The university was modelled on the University of Prague, from which the German-speaking faculty members withdrew to Leipzig after the Jan Hus crisis and the Decree of Kutná Hora.
The Alma mater Lipsiensis opened in 1409, after it had been officially endorsed by Pope Alexander V in his Bull of Acknowledgment on (September 9 of that year).
As many European universities, the university of Leipzig was structured into colleges (Collegia) responsible for organising accommodation and collegiate lecturing.
Among the colleges of Leipzig were the Small College, the Large College, the Red College (also known as the New College), the College of our Lady and the Pauliner-College.
This changed, however, during the 19th century when the university became a world-class institution of higher education and research.
[citation needed] At the end of the 19th century, important scholars such as Bernhard Windscheid (one of the fathers of the German Civil Code) and Wilhelm Ostwald (viewed as a founder of modern physical chemistry) taught at Leipzig.
At its general assembly in 1873, the Allgemeiner Deutscher Frauenverein thanked the University of Leipzig and Prague for allowing women to attend as guest students.
Until the beginning of the Second World War, Leipzig University attracted a number of renowned scholars and later Nobel Prize laureates, including Paul Ehrlich, Felix Bloch, Werner Heisenberg and Sin-Itiro Tomonaga.
Nazi period[edit]Under Nazi rule many Jews' degrees were cancelled; some were later reinstated as Karl-Marx University degrees by the GDR.
The special task of repairing the damage caused by air attacks has now broadened out to the more general duty to save the continuity of our university and preserve its substance, at the very least its indestructible kernel, through the crisis that has now reached its fullest stage.
After the destruction of most of the buildings and the majority of its libraries, this kernel is represented by the professoriate alone.
By the end of the war 60 per cent of the university's buildings and 70 per cent of its books had been destroyed.
The University under the German Democratic Republic[edit]The university reopened after the war on February 5, 1946, but it was affected by the uniformity imposed on social institutions in the Soviet occupation zone.
The chairman of the Student Council, Wolfgang Natonek, and other members were arrested and imprisoned, but the university was also a nucleus of resistance.
The German Democratic Republic was created in 1949, and in 1953 the University was renamed by its government the Karl Marx University, Leipzig after the German communist philosopher Karl Marx.
In 1968, the partly damaged Augusteum, including Johanneum and Albertinum and the intact Paulinerkirche, were demolished to make way for a redevelopment of the university, carried out between 1973 and 1978.
The dominant building of the university was the University Tower (now City-Hochhaus Leipzig), built between 1968 and 1972 in the form of an open book.
After the reunification of Germany[edit]In 1991, following the reunification of Germany, the University's name was restored to the original Leipzig University (Alma mater lipsiensis).
The reconstruction of the University Library, which was heavily damaged during the war and in the GDR barely secured, was completed in 2002.
In 2008 the university was able to prevail in the nationwide "Initiative of Excellence" of Germany and it was granted the graduate school "BuildMoNa: Leipzig School of Natural Sciences – Building with Molecules and Nano-objects".
In addition the university was able to receive grants from the Saxon excellence initiative for the "Life" project – a project that tries to explore common diseases more effectively.
With the delivery of the University Tower to a private user, the university was forced to spread some faculties over several locations in the city.
In 2002, Behet Bonzio received the second prize in the architectural competition; a first prize was not awarded by the jury.
This caused the resistance of the university leadership, the majority of the students and population of Leipzig.
These disputes led to a scandal in early 2003; the Rector Volker Bigl, and the pro-rectors resigned in protest against the government.
This was exacerbated by severe tensions that built up because of the Saxon university treaty on the future funding of higher education.
As a compromise a second competition was agreed upon, which only covered the Augustusplatz front of the university.
On March 24, 2004 a jury chose a design by Dutch architect Erick van Egeraat, which was well received by almost all parties.
In 2009, the Leipzig University celebrated its 600th anniversary with over 300 scientific and cultural lectures and exhibitions, reflecting the role of the university's research and teaching from its beginning.
It is one of the oldest German university libraries and it serves as a source of literature and information for the Leipzig University as well as the general public in the region.
The library consists of the main building "Bibliotheca Albertina" and forty branches situated near their respective academic institutions.
Collections range from important medieval and modern manuscripts to incunabula, papyri, autographs, ostraka and coins.
The Apel Codex, a manuscript of 16th century music, is housed in the Leipzig University library, as well as the Papyrus Ebers.
The main buildings in the city center are still located on the same land plots as the earliest university buildings in 1409.
The university's buildings in the center of Leipzig underwent substantial reconstruction from 2005, the new university's main building being drafted by Dutch architect Erick van Egeraat.
The new buildings were scheduled to be completed in 2009/2010, in time for the university's 600th anniversary celebrations.
Besides the faculties and other teaching institutions, several other bodies serve the university: the University Library, a university archive and administration, numerous museums (e.
The University's Musical Instrument Museum includes one of the world's three surviving pianos built by Bartolomeo Cristofori, the piano's inventor.

Employment and racial discrimination is illegal under German anti-discrimination legislation (General Equal Treatment Act of 2006, Germany) and a possible violation of the European Convention on Human Rights.
Alleged boycott of Indian male students[edit]The incident gained increased media attention after the appearance of e-mails sent by Beck-Sickinger referencing an organized 'vigilante-style' embargo on Indian male students by female professors in Germany and other organizations in Europe.
Beck-Sickinger implied that a male Indian student would put the female students of her research group at risk:Unfortunately, I don't accept any Indian male students for internships.
The incident made other students come forward and allege that they too had been victims of Beck-Sickinger's 'vigilante' actions and had their internship applications rejected for similar reasons.
Social media called upon university authorities in Germany to offer an unconditional apology and for action against the professor.
Widespread news coverage and television debates prompted suggestions that legal action be taken against the Leipzig University since the discriminatory e-mails were sent by Beck-Sickinger in her capacity as a senior university official.
Beate ScHücking, the students council of the university was said to have had the opportunity to review all relevant e-mails.

de    Bielefeld University  The central hall of the university  Bielefeld University on the north side of Teutoburg Forest  Bielefeld University building XBielefeld University (German: Universität Bielefeld) is a university in Bielefeld, Germany.
Founded in 1969, it is one of the country's newer universities, and considers itself a "reform" university, following a different style of organization and teaching than the established universities.
In particular, the university aims to "re-establish the unity between research and teaching", and so all its faculty teach courses in their area of research.
The university also stresses a focus on interdisciplinary research, helped by the architecture, which encloses all faculties in one great structure.
Bielefeld University has started an extensive multi-phase modernisation project, which upon completion in 2025 would result in completely new university buildings to replace the 40-year-old main building.
Contents  [hide] 1 Faculties2 Central academic institutes3 Oberstufen-Kolleg at the University of Bielefeld4 Library5 Protests against tuition fees6 Location7 Statistics8 References9 External linksFaculties[edit]Bielefeld University is known for its faculty of sociology.
The faculty of history launched the "Bielefeld School" of Social History under Hans-Ulrich Wehler, while the Laborschule and Center for Interdisciplinary Research (ZiF) are projects of the faculty of educational science.
The Academic Ranking of World Universities of 2010 places Bielefeld in terms of mathematics among the four best universities of Germany, the 21 best universities of Europe and 51 to 76 best universities in the world, which confirms the ranking of 2009.
In the Times Higher Education World University Rankings of 2010-2011 Bielefeld is placed among the top 50 engineering and technology universities.
Since 1998, the Kolleg has worked together with the German School of Guayaquil in a charitable project to help in the development of the town of Daular, Ecuador, which project won a United Nations Award in 2006/2007 for its international concept.
Library[edit]Bielefeld University Library occupies most of the first floor of the main university building and contains over 2.
It is open every day of the year, from 08:00 until 01:00 Monday to Friday, and from 09:00 to 22:00 during weekends and public holidays.
Protests against tuition fees[edit]Bielefeld University was one of the centers of student protests in the fight against the introduction of tuition fees.
In the course of the protests, the central hall and the university president's office were occupied by protesting students for over a month.
In a vote organised by the AStA and the students parliament, about 94 percent of the participants voted against the introduction of tuition fees, although only 22 percent of the students cast their vote.
In its session of July 12, 2006, the university senate decided to introduce tuition fees of €500 per semester, beginning in 2007.
The cost of the damage, mainly due to the replacement of thousands of locks, was estimated at over a million euros.
The main building, which houses all the faculties and institutes, as well as the large library, is a functional concrete structure, typical of the 1960s.
Intercity trains running between Cologne/Bonn and Berlin stop regularly at Bielefeld, and the university can be accessed via city tram (Line 4) in about 10 minutes from the city center—or in about 15 minutes by car.

de Logo of the Helmut Schmidt University The Helmut Schmidt University (German: Helmut-Schmidt-Universität), located in Hamburg, Germany, is a German military educational establishment that was founded in 1973 at the initiative of the then-Federal Minister of Defence, Helmut Schmidt.
Originally known as the "University of the Bundeswehr Hamburg" (Universität der Bundeswehr), its complete official name today is "Helmut-Schmidt-Universität/Universität der Bundeswehr Hamburg".
It is one of two universities that were established by the Bundeswehr to train and educate its future and existing officers.
In general, it is accessible only to officers and officer candidates of the Bundeswehr, hence its original name.
However, since it started teaching, there have been cooperation agreements with allied countries, on the basis of which a handful of selected officers from these states have been able to study in Hamburg.
These scholarships are usually awarded by foundations with close relationships to industry – thus, these students are at least indirectly being supported by their future employer, usually large companies.
As of 2011 training costs are currently 6000 euros (humanities), 8000 euros (economics) or 10000 euros (engineering) per academic year.
Academic degrees and titles obtained at HSU are equivalent to those awarded by state universities and are equally valid, since the courses comply with the requirements of Hamburg's higher education legislation.
The first classes of students began schooling on 1 October 1973 and the first graduate left the university on 30 September 1976.
Renaming[edit]It was in the December 2003 that the University of the German Federal Armed Forces Hamburg was rechristened "Helmut Schmidt University / University of the German Federal Armed Forces Hamburg" to honour the man who passed the decree for the university's establishment.
Faculties and courses[edit]At the Helmut Schmidt University there is a specific organizational structure, in addition to the division between the areas of teaching and administration that is common to all universities.
This is due to the HSU's dual function as an educational establishment and a military authority for the students.
Academic Division[edit]The academic division takes care of teaching and research, to which end it maintains 4 faculties.
The number of departments was designed so as to allow for intensive study through teaching in small groups, and for the pursuing of research at the same time.
The course Industrial Engineering is not assigned to any one faculty, due to its mixed nature, but the Faculty of Electrical Engineering has taken the leading role in teaching it.
The "ISA-Modul", with ISA standing for "Interdisziplinäre Studienanteile" (Interdisciplinary parts of study) is not assigned to a particular faculty.
All ISA courses are coordinated by a research associate, who liaises with the teaching staff of the 4 faculties.
Student Division[edit]The personal guidance, training and education of the studying officers and officer candidates is the responsibility of the "Studentenbereich" (SB) or "Student Division".
In the course of the reforms of army training and the correspondingly higher student numbers in 2007 and 2008, 2 more group leaders per Student Department were added for the period 2007-2011, which meant an increase from 4 to 6, or 6 to 8 for SFB C.
The staff-student ratio is currently at around 140 to 180 studying officers and officer candidates per group leader.
Apart from the administrative management of the soldiers, the Student Division takes care of military training and advanced education so as to maintain the necessary educational level.
If compared with a normal military unit, the Student Division would be equivalent to a regiment, the Departments to a battalion and the Groups to companies.
An orientation week takes place first, during which the students may settle into their accommodation and receive an introduction to studying at the HSU from the more advanced students.
In contrast to the semester format usually practised in Germany, a year at the HSU is divided into 3 terms (trimesters) which means that it consists not of a winter and summer semester, but of autumn, winter and spring terms, 3 blocks of 3 months each.
This period may be used for performing required periods of practical training and internships, and for holidays.
For the purpose of revision, one or two weeks in mid-December, late March and late June may be devoid of classes.
Due to the short length of revision time and the fact that all the exams are "en bloc", resits are greatly feared by the students, particularly the engineering students.
Resit exams occur during the exam block of the next term, and in this way a "bow wave" of an ever-increasing number of exams to take can accumulate, which may be very difficult to remain on top of.
The maximum period of study is 4 years, which means that one's Master's thesis must be submitted on 30 September of the 4th year of study at the latest.
The study period may only be extended over 4 years with the permission of the Personnel Office of the Bundeswehr, and even then, one requires a certificate from the university stating that the student is likely to successfully complete his or her studies in the near future.
After completion of one's studies, that is after one has submitted one's final dissertation, the officer will return to a post in the army or the fleet relatively quickly, according to availability of vacant posts, the officer's leave entitlement and course plans.
As part of the graduation ceremony, the Böttcher-Preis, founded by the Hamburg businessman Johann Max Böttcher, is awarded to the highest-performing students of each year.
These include the computer centre, the language centre, the media centre, and the Centre for Technology-Assisted Education (Zentrum für technologiegestützte Bildung: ZTB).
According to the library ranking list "Bibliotheksindex" (BIX), it has been amongst the best libraries in Germany for years.
The library primarily exists to support the teaching and research of the HSU, but is also accessible to the general public.
7 professorships work on projects in this area, including: Acoustics, Propulsion, Computer-aided engineering, Chassis, Production engineering, and Simulators.
In Electrical Engineering, one of the areas of research is telecommunications, which includes: Audio coding, Wireless transmission systems, and Video recognition systems.
In educational sciences, the focus is on the areas of professional and organizational education, adult education and history.
In economic and management sciences, the emphasis is on logistics, business administration and economics, and political science.
Student life[edit]Campus and accommodation[edit]The HSU is designed as a campus university, and its campus in the Wandsbek district consists of 3 parts.
Studying activities take place on the premises of the former Douaumont barracks on the Holstenhofweg in Hamburg-Jenfeld.
The university administration is located here, as well as all departments and faculties, lecture theatres and laboratories and central facilities; it also contains sports facilities, the canteen and the management of the Student Division.
South of the BAB 24, on the premised of the former Hanseatic barracks in the Stoltenstraße in Horn, is the accommodation for students of humanities and social sciences, and economics, and the medical facility.
A third residence, rapidly constructed, is located since 2007 on the Jenfelder Allee and will be used until 2010.
In addition, from 2007 to 2010, flats will be rented on the private market, in order to absorb the overload of students, which is due to the unusually well-attended years of 2007 and 2008.
In principle, every student receives a single room with area of 14 to 20 m2 (151 to 215 sq ft), mostly with en-suite bathroom and toilet.
During the time of higher than usual student numbers however, there will invitably be some instances where 2 students share a larger room.
Residents may cook in the shared kitchens, where the social life between studies and the Hamburg night life will take place.
Due to structural changes in military training, several external residences had to be acquired including the former Lettow-Vorbeck Barracks, which is now used by the Federal Police (Bundespolizei).
Another facility frequented by students and staff is the casino, the officer's club of the HSU (not a gambling establishment), located opposite the campus.
Financing[edit]Whilst studying, the soldiers are paid according to their rank and length of service, sometimes including a residence allowance and a family allowance.
Leisure activities and nightlife[edit]Due to the quite strict study plan, compared with public universities, it is often not easy for students to pursue leisure activities.
In the course of the years, however, many different clubs and societies have been formed, to enable leisure activities without clashing with study obligations.
The offers first-term students a possibility to get to know each other, and more advanced students the possibility to swap tales from their holidays.
Since 2008, that time has been increased to 13 years, in response to changes in the education caused by the introduction of the Bachelor/Master system.
To join the officer corps, a 3-day selection process must be successfully completed at the officer candidates selection centre in Köln-Porz at the Mudra barracks.
Depending on which service branch and which specialty one chooses, one will complete the requisite military training with that unit, before being posted to the university and completing the academic education there, which is a part of the training for becoming an officer.
The educational requirement for attending the HSU is a general higher education entrance qualification that is recognized by the law on higher education of the Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg.
Military aspects of student life[edit]Prior to their studies, soldiers must train at one of the three respective Officer Training school: for the Army in Dresden /('OSH'), for the Air Force in Fürstenfeldbruck ('OSLw') and for the Navy in Flensburg ('MSM').
During their stay at the HSU, military personnel are required to complete certain standard procedures every year.
These include:•6/12 km marches on foot with 15 kg backpack•German Sports Badge•Basic Fitness Tests•NBC Training•First Aid Training•Small Arms TrainingOn occasion:•political education•Training courses (such as MOUT etc.

de University of Bonn Logo The University of Bonn (German: Rheinische Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität Bonn) is a public research university located in Bonn, Germany.
Founded in its present form in 1818, as the linear successor of earlier academic institutions, the University of Bonn is today one of the leading universities in Germany.
Among its notable alumni and faculty are seven Nobel Laureates, three Fields Medalist, twelve Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Prize winners, Prince Albert, Pope Benedict XVI, Frederick III, Karl Marx, Heinrich Heine, Friedrich Nietzsche, Konrad Adenauer, and Joseph Schumpeter.
The Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2016 and the Academic Ranking of World Universities 2015 ranked the University of Bonn as one of the 100 best universities in the world.

jpg The university's forerunner was the Kurkölnische Akademie Bonn (English: Academy of the Prince-elector of Cologne) which was founded in 1777 by Maximilian Frederick of Königsegg-Rothenfels, the prince-elector of Cologne.
The academy was closed in 1798 after the left bank of the Rhine was occupied by France during the French Revolutionary Wars.
At this time there was no university in the Rhineland, as all three universities that existed until the end of the 18th century were closed as a result of the French occupation.
The new Rhein University (German: Rhein-Universität) was then founded on 18 October 1818 by Frederick William III.
It was the sixth Prussian University, founded after the universities in Greifswald, Berlin, Königsberg, Halle and Breslau.
This was one of the reasons why Bonn, with its tradition of a nonsectarian university, was chosen over Cologne and Duisburg.
Apart from a school of Roman Catholic theology and a school of Protestant theology, the university had schools for medicine, law and philosophy.
In the spirit of Wilhelm von Humboldt the constitution emphasized the autonomy of the university and the unity of teaching and research.
Similar to the University of Berlin, which was founded in 1810, the new constitution made the University of Bonn a modern research university.
Only one year after the inception of the Rhein University the dramatist August von Kotzebue was murdered by Karl Ludwig Sand, a student at the University of Jena.
The Carlsbad Decrees, introduced on 20 September 1819 led to a general crackdown on universities, the dissolution of the Burschenschaften and the introduction of censorship laws.
One victim was the author and poet Ernst Moritz Arndt, who, freshly appointed university professor in Bonn, was banned from teaching.
Another consequence of the Carlsbad Decrees was the refusal by Frederick William III to confer the chain of office, the official seal and an official name to the new university.
The Rhein University was thus nameless until 1840, when the new King of Prussia, Frederick William IV gave it the official name Rheinische Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität.
Friedrich August Kekulé von Stradonitz was a professor of chemistry at the University of Bonn from 1867 to 1896.
At the end of the 19th century the university was also known as the Prinzenuniversität (English:Princes' university), as many of the sons of the king of Prussia studied here.
In 1900 the university had 68 chairs, 23 adjunct chairs, two honorary professors, 57 Privatdozenten and six lecturers.
Financial and economic problems in Germany in the aftermath of the war resulted in reduced government funding for the university.
To that effect the student council Astag (German: Allgemeine Studentische Arbeitsgemeinschaft) was founded in the same year.
After the Nazi takeover of power in 1933 the Gleichschaltung transformed the university into a Nazi educational institution.
According to the Führerprinzip the autonomous and self-governening administration of the university was replaced by a hierarchy of leaders resembling the military, with the university president being subordinate to the ministry of education.
The theologian Karl Barth was forced to resign and to emigrate to Switzerland for refusing to swear an oath to Hitler.
The Jewish mathematician Felix Hausdorff was expelled from the university in 1935 and committed suicide after learning about his impending deportation to a concentration camp in 1942.
The philosophers Paul Ludwig Landsberg and Johannes Maria Verweyen were deported and died in concentration camps.
The first university president was Heinrich Matthias Konen, who was expelled from the university in 1934 because of his opposition to Nazism.
At the start of the first semester on 17 November 1945 the university had more than 10,000 applicants for only 2,500 places.
Significant events of the postwar era were the relocation of the university hospital from the city center to the Venusberg in 1949, the opening of the new university library in 1960 and the opening of a new building, the Juridicum, for the School of Law and Economics in 1967.
In 1980 the Pedagogigal University Bonn was merged into the University of Bonn, although eventually all the teachers education programs were closed in 2007.
The decision of the German government to move the capital from Bonn to Berlin after the reunification in 1991 resulted in generous compensation for the city of Bonn.
The compensation package included three new research institutes affiliated or closely collaborating with the university, thus significantly enhancing the research profile of the University of Bonn.
In the 2000s the university implemented the Bologna process and replaced the traditional Diplom and Magister programs with Bachelor and Master programs.
Strong fields as identified by the university are mathematics, physics, law, economics, neuroscience, medical genetics, chemical biology, agriculture, Asian and Oriental studies and Philosophy and Ethics.
The university has a standing faculty of more than 500 professors, an academic staff of 3,900 and a support staff of 4,800.
Schools[edit]From the foundation in 1818 to 1928 the University of Bonn had five schools, that is, the School of Catholic Theology, the School of Protestant Theology, the School of Law and the School of Arts and Science.
In 1928 the School of Law and the Department of Economics, that until then was part of the School of Arts and Science, merged into the new School of Law and Economics.
In 1934 the until then independent Agricultural University Bonn-Poppelsdorf (German: Landwirtschaftliche Hochschule Bonn-Poppelsdorf) was merged into the University of Bonn as the School of Agricultural Science.
The institute edits the Reallexikon für Antike und Christentum, a German language encyclopedia treating the history of early Christians in the late antiquity.
The institute is named after the church historian Franz Joseph Dölger who was a professor of theology at the university from 1929 to 1940.
The Research Institute for Discrete Mathematics focuses on discrete mathematics and its applications, in particular combinatorial optimization and the design of computer chips.
The Bethe Center for Theoretical Physics "is a joint enterprise of theoretical physicists and mathematicians at various institutes of or connected with the University of Bonn.
In the spirit of Hans Bethe it fosters research activities over a wide range of theoretical and mathematical physics.
" Activities of the Bethe Center include short and long term visitors program, workshops on dedicated research topics, regular Bethe Seminar Series, lectures and seminars for graduate students.
The German Reference Center for Ethics in the Life Sciences (German: Deutsches Referenzzentrum für Ethik in den Biowissenschaften) was founded in 1999 and is modeled after the National Reference Center for Bioethics Literature at Georgetown University.
The center provides access to scientific information to academics and professionals in the fields of life science and is the only of its kind in Germany.
After the German Government's decision in 1991 to move the capital of Germany from Bonn to Berlin, the city of Bonn received generous compensation from the Federal Government.

The main building is the Kurfürstliches Schloss, the former residential palace of the prince-elector of Cologne in the city center.
The main building was built by Enrico Zuccalli for the prince-elector of Cologne, Joseph Clemens of Bavaria from 1697–1705.
The Hofgarten, a large park in front of the main building is a popular place for students to meet, study and relax.
The Hofgarten was repeatedly the place for political demonstrations as for example the demonstration against the NATO Double-Track Decision on 22 October 1981 with about 250,000 participants.
The school of law and economics, the main university library and several smaller departments are housed in modern buildings a short distance south of the main building.
The science departments and the main science library are located in Poppelsdorf and Endenich, west of the city center, and housed in a mix of historical and modern buildings.
Notable is the Poppelsdorf Palace (German: Poppelsdorfer Schloss), which was built from 1715 to 1753 by Robert de Cotte for Joseph Clemens of Bavaria and his successor Clemens August of Bavaria.
Today the Poppelsdorf Palace houses the university's mineral collection and several science departments; its grounds are the university's botanical garden (the Botanische Gärten der Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität Bonn).
University Library[edit]  Building of the University LibraryThe university library was founded in 1818 and started with 6,000 volumes inherited from the library of the closed University of Duisburg.
The library contained about 200,000 volumes at the end of the 19th century, and about 600,000 volumes at the outbreak of World War II.
After the war the library was housed in several makeshift locations until the completion of the new central library in 1960.
Today, the university library system comprises the central library, the library for science, agriculture and medicine and about 160 smaller libraries.
In 1883 the hospital moved to a new building in the city center of Bonn, and after World War II to the Venusberg on the western edge of Bonn.
Although the university hospital is since then independent from the university, the School of Medicine of the University of Bonn and the university hospital closely collaborate.
Today the university hospital comprises about thirty individual hospitals, employs more than 670 physicians and more than 1,100 nursing and clinical support staff and treated about 39,000 inpatients.
University Museums[edit]The Akademisches Kunstmuseum (English: Academic Museum of Antiquities ) was founded in 1818 and has one of the largest collections of plaster casts of ancient Greek and Roman sculptures in the world.
They were first used in the instruction of university students in 1763 by Christian Gottlob Heyne at University of Göttingen.
The Akademisches Kunstmuseum in Bonn was the first of its kind, as at this time collections at other universities were scattered around universities libraries.
From 1870 to 1889 Reinhard Kekulé von Stradonitz, nephew of the famous organic chemist Friedrich August Kekulé von Stradonitz, was the director.
The building was constructed from 1823 to 1830 and designed by Karl Friedrich Schinkel and Hermann Friedrich Waesemann.
Other directors of the museum were Georg Loeschcke (from 1889 to 1912), Franz Winter (from 1912 to 1929), Richard Delbrueck (from 1929 to 1940), Ernst Langlotz (from 1944 to 1966), Nikolaus Himmelmann (from 1969 to 1994) and Harald Mielsch (since 1994).
All directors, with the exception of Friedrich Wilhelm Ritschl held a professorship of archaeology at the university.
The Teaching Collection of Archaeology and Anthropology (German: Archäologisch-ethnographische Lehr- und Studiensammlung) was opened in 2008.
A garden existed at the same place at least since 1578, and around 1720 a Baroque garden was built for Clemens August of Bavaria.
In 1882 it was split into the Mineralogical Museum located in the Poppelsdorf Palace and a museum of palaeontology, now named Goldfuß Museum of Palaeontology.
The Horst Stoeckel-Museum of the History of Anesthesiology (German: Horst Stoeckel-Museum für die Geschichte der Anästhesiologie) was opened in 2000 and is the largest of its kind in Europe.
The Museum Alexander Koenig is one of the largest natural history museums in Germany and is affiliated with the university.
The museum was founded in 1912 by Alexander Koenig, who donated his collection of mounted specimen to the public.

de Bundeswehr University Munich (German: Universität der Bundeswehr München, UniBw München) is one of only two federal research universities in Germany that both were founded in 1973 as part of the German Armed Forces (Bundeswehr).
Originally called Hochschule der Bundeswehr München the institution was supposed to offer civilian academic education for military officers.
The academic year at the university is structured in trimesters and not the usual semesters, to offer intensive studies with more credit points per year.
Very capable students can therefore achieve a bachelor's and a master's degree within less than four years, while this would usually require five years.
Universität der Bundeswehr München has well-established scientific research and forms part of two excellence clusters of the German government's university excellence initiative.
In 1970 the then minister of defence Helmut Schmidt decided that the education of military officers in Germany had to be reviewed and had to include full academic studies.
After one year the Ellwein commission presented its proposal for the creation of two civilian colleges within the armed forces.
Students should get fully recognised civilian degrees independent of their military profession, to have a higher qualified officer corps and more incentives to join the military.
The idea was that students would have better conditions than at normal universities so that they could cope with a higher workload and study faster.
University education normally being a responsibility of the German states, Universität der Bundeswehr München and Helmut Schmidt University are the only federal universities in Germany.
With their innovative concepts Helmut Schmidt University and Universität der Bundeswehr München quickly became widely known as reform universities within the very traditional German university landscape.
In the following years the universities had to establish their image and reputation and finally were accepted as full universities with the rights to award doctorate degrees as well as Habilitations to qualify university professors in the 80s.
In the 90s and 2000s the university has started to open its teaching towards civilian students and to extend its international relations.
While the researchers and doctorate students always used to be mainly civilians, the student body still had been purely military in the 90s.
Today, Universität der Bundeswehr München has concluded partnership contracts with different major financial and industrial companies, which send students to Universität der Bundeswehr München.
It has completely restructed its curriculums and awards bachelor's and master's degrees instead of the former German Diplom.
Since the 1970s a large number of buildings has been built for teaching, scientific research and student housing.
Most of the students live in modern individual student dormitories on the campus and next to the university buildings.
There is currently a large renovation process ongoing on the campus: within the next years about € 220m will be spent on building activities.
Different multinational engineering companies have their headquarters or important industrial facilities directly next to the campus, most notably Siemens, Infineon Technologies, Bosch and Siemens Household Appliances (BSH), and EADS facilitating frequent cooperation in research.
International initiatives like the German-American, German-Israeli or German-Hispanic clubs as well as the Model United Nations Society play an important role on the campus.
As a large part of the student body consists of military officers and officer candidates, sport is considered important on the campus.
There are a lot of sports facilities like gyms, different sports halls, a golf course, a large climbing wall, an indoor swimming pool, several tennis courts and other sports grounds.
Furthermore, the university has a large military obstacle course which was used for the CISM world cup in 2009.
Administration and organization[edit]The organization of Universität der Bundeswehr München is similar to a usual university.
A difference to most other universities is that the structure of education and research is split up between normal university part with seven university faculties and a Fachhochschule (College of Applied Sciences) part with three more faculties.
Furthermore, the structure contains central services like the computing center, the large university library, a media center with state-of-the-art technology, a language service and the sport services.
The department for special services includes the Studium+ institute for interdisciplinary studies, the CASC center for postgraduate studies as well as some further services.
Another difference to other universities is the military division which is responsible for the administration and training of military students.
Decisions are made by the board, the extended board and the administration council (Senate and University Council).
The university has about 850 non-scientific employees in addition to the about 570 scientific employees as well as additional military personnel.
Academics[edit]Similar to some other military run universities like the École Polytechnique the university only offers civilian study courses.
The contents generally have no relation to the military and correspond to courses at regular German universities.
Due to this there also is a small number of highly gifted civilian students who are sponsored by industrial and financial companies like Allianz, Bosch or Munich Re.
In addition to that other German ministries and federal institutions like Bundesnachrichtendienst also educate some of their employees at the university.
Marshall European Center for Security Studies a course of studies for senior leaders (International Strategic Studies) has been introduced.
Universität der Bundeswehr has concluded partnership contracts with an increasing number of international universities.
Furthermore, it is possible for civilians to receive a doctorate or to qualify as a university lecturer (Habilitation).
All of the professors are civilians and the number of professors per student is significantly higher than at normal German universities.
In autumn 2009 the university introduced the first military related engineering course of study called Defence Engineering, which is solely dedicated to civilian students from industrial companies and federal institutions.
Military students of the university usually only have a maximum of 4 years to pass their Master's within the intensive studies with more content.
As the studies have to be finished in a shorter time than at common German universities the academic year consists of three trimesters instead of the normal two semesters.
autumn trimester Study courses[edit]The university has restructured its courses of study according to the Bologna treaty and offers bachelor's and master's degrees as well as doctoral and postdoctoral studies.

Indeed, gender equality, and equal treatment for those from different social, ethnic and religious backgrounds, as well as educational integration in general, are important parts of the university's mission.
Interdisciplinary work, and narrowing the gap between theory and practice, are important components of the research and teaching profile.
Its educational studies programs as well as cultural studies and applied linguistics are the traditional strength.
In addition, Psychology, Childhood Education, Diversity Education, Translation Studies, Intercultural Communication, Environmental Studies and Business Information/Computer Science programs are also in high demand.
Since 2003, the University of Hildesheim has been a foundation under public law, and therefore enjoys a comparatively high degree of autonomy.
As a public foundation, the University of Hildesheim maintains close relationships with civil society, and a strong network of affiliation with educational, scientific and cultural institutions, as well as economic and business organizations.
Students are active partners in the teaching and learning processes, and they are encouraged to be involved in the development and improvement of teaching and study.
Through its own scholarship programs (such as the College of Minerva and Lore-Auerbach Scholarships), the University of Hildesheim supports especially-capable and socially-committed students.
Moreover, regular course evaluations show that a majority of students are “mostly satisfied” or “very satisfied” with their courses, and students particularly appreciate the engagement and commitment of the faculty.
Accreditation reports have also noted the high level of teacher commitment and motivation among university faculty, as well as the personal atmosphere between students and professors.

de Data as of June 2016   Entrance University of ErfurtThe University of Erfurt (German: Universität Erfurt) is a public university located in Erfurt, Germany, the capital city of the state of Thuringia.
Originally founded in 1379, the university was closed in 1816 for the next 177 years, until its re-establishment in 1994, three years after the reunification of Germany.
The institution identifies itself as a reform university, occasioned by the attendance of Lutheran theologian Martin Luther's from 1501 to 1505.
The University of Erfurt is home to such institutes as the Max Weber Center for Advanced Cultural and Social Studies, the Gotha Research Center for Cultural and Social Scientific Studies, and the Willy Brandt School of Public Policy.
Holding one of Germany's largest collections of early modern documents, the Gotha Research Library belongs to the University of Erfurt.
The Erfurt–Gotha library system also houses the famous Bibliotheca Amploniana—a collection of nearly 1000 medieval manuscripts collected by the scholar Amplonius Rating de Berka—and encompasses the Perthes Collection, preserved in the Perthes Forum.
2 Re-establishment (since 1996)6 See also7 References8 External linksHistory[edit]1379–1816[edit]The University of Erfurt was founded in 1379 in the Holy Roman Empire, in terrority which is now modern day Germany.
When the town of Erfurt became part of Prussia in 1816, the government closed the university after more than 400 years of operation.
Collegium Maius1994–present[edit]Lying in the state of Thuringia, Erfurt was part of the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) from 1949 to 1990.
In December 1993, the State Government of Thuringia, Landtag of Thuringia, voted to re-establish the university.
Shortly afterwards, the rector who had overseen the founding, Peter Glotz, a politician in the SPD party, left the university.
In 2001, the Erfurt Teachers' Training College (Pädagogische Hochschule Erfurt), founded in 1953, became part of the university.
On January 1, 2003, a fourth faculty was added to the university: the Roman Catholic Theological Faculty, which previously belonged to Erfurt's Philosophical and Theological Centre (Philosophisch-Theologisches Studium Erfurt).
In the same year, a chronic lack of financing meant that there were many redundancies and that vacancies were left unfilled.
Once this situation led to student protests all over Thuringia, the university administration and committees were reformed to stabilise it.
The close integration of the Philosophical, Educational Research, Governmental Studies, and Catholic Theological Faculty, as well as the Max Weber Center, promotes interdisciplinary alongside innovative approaches to research and teaching through a mentoring program.
University of Erfurt’s libraryThe University of Erfurt has no tuition fees and represents the first institution of higher education to receive the family-friendly certificate for employers.

In 1798, the university was abolished by the French, who had invaded Cologne in 1794, because under the new French constitution, universities were abolished all over France.
1919–today[edit]  Main building, by architect Adolf Abel, 1934In 1919, the Prussian government endorsed a decision by the Cologne City Council to re-establish the university.
At that point, the new university was located in Neustadt-Süd, but relocated to its current campus in Lindenthal on 2 November 1934.
Initially, the university was composed of the Faculty of Commerce, Economics and Social Sciences (successor to the Institutes of Commerce and of Communal and Social Administration) and the Faculty of Medicine (successor to the Academy of Medicine).
In 1920, the Faculty of Law and the Faculty of Arts were added, from which latter the School of Mathematics and Natural Sciences was split off in 1955 to form a separate Faculty.
In 1980, the two Cologne departments of the Rhineland School of Education were attached to the university as the Faculties of Education and of Special Education.
In 1988, the university became a founding member of the Community of European Management Schools and International Companies (CEMS), today's Global Alliance in Management Education.
The University is a leader in the area of economics and is regularly placed in top positions for law and commerce, both for national and international rankings.
Organization[edit]  University campus between main building and mensa (the university canteen)The University of Cologne is a statutory corporation (Körperschaft des öffentlichen Rechts), operated by the Federal State of North Rhine-Westphalia.

jpg The Goethe University Frankfurt (German: Johann Wolfgang Goethe-Universität Frankfurt am Main) is a university in Frankfurt, Germany.
It was founded in 1914 as a citizens' university, which means that, while a state university of Prussia, it was founded and funded by the wealthy and active liberal citizenry of Frankfurt, a unique feature in German university history.
In 1932, the university's name was extended in honour of one of the most famous locals of Frankfurt, the poet and writer Johann Wolfgang von Goethe.
During the Nazi period, "almost one third of its academics and many of its students were dismissed for racial and/or political reasons—more than at any other German university"[citation needed].
The university has historically best been known for its Institute for Social Research (founded 1924), the institutional home of the Frankfurt School, a preeminent 20th century school of philosophy and social thought.
Some of the well-known scholars associated with this school include Theodor Adorno, Max Horkheimer, and Jürgen Habermas, as well as Herbert Marcuse, Erich Fromm, and Walter Benjamin[citation needed].
The university also has been influential in the natural sciences and medicine, with Nobel Prize winners including Max von Laue and Max Born, and breakthroughs such as the Stern–Gerlach experiment.
In recent years, the university has focused in particular on law, history, and economics, creating new institutes, such as the Institute for Law and Finance (ILF) and the Center for Financial Studies (CFS)[citation needed].
One of the university's ambitions is to become Germany's leading university for finance and economics, given the school's proximity to one of Europe's financial centers.
Goethe university has established an international award for research in financial economics, the Deutsche Bank Prize in Financial Economics.
Organization[edit]  Campus Westend  University Library at Campus WestendThe university consists of 16 faculties.
Campus Westend[edit] IG Farben Building at Uni Frankfurt IG Farben Building at Campus Westend“Campus Westend” of the University is dominated by the IG Farben Building by architect Hans Poelzig, an example of neoclassicist architecture[citation needed].
The style for the IG Farben Building was originally chosen as "a symbol for the scientific and mercantile German manpower, made out of iron and stone", as the IG Farben director at the time of construction, Baron von Schnitzler, stated in his opening speech in October 1930.
When the university took over the complex, the same style was also adopted for several new buildings[citation needed].
On 30 May 2008, the House of Finance relocated to a new building designed by the architects Kleihues+Kleihues, following the style of the IG Farben Building.
The upper floors of the House of Finance building have several separate offices as well as shared office space for researchers and students.
The ground floor is open to the public and welcomes visitors with a spacious, naturally lit foyer that leads to lecture halls, seminar rooms, and the information center, a 24-hour reference library.
The floors, walls and ceiling of the foyer are decorated with a grid design that is continued throughout the entire building.

de The Martin Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg (German: Martin-Luther-Universität Halle-Wittenberg), also referred to as MLU, is a public, research-oriented university in the cities of Halle and Wittenberg within Saxony-Anhalt, Germany.
The university was created in 1817 through the merger of the University of Wittenberg (founded 1502) and the University of Halle (founded 1691).
Today, the university itself is located in Halle, while the Leucorea Foundation in Wittenberg serves as MLU’s convention centre (and hotel) for seminars as well as for academic and political conferences.
Both Halle and Wittenberg are about one hour from Berlin via the Berlin–Halle railway, which offers Intercity-Express (ICE) trains.
Under the influence of Philipp Melanchthon, building on the works of Martin Luther, the university became a centre of the Protestant Reformation, even incorporating, at one point in time, Luther's house in Wittenberg, the Lutherhaus, as part of the campus.
Notable attendees include George Müller, Georg Joachim Rheticus and – in fiction – William Shakespeare's Prince Hamlet and Horatio and Christopher Marlowe's Doctor Faustus.
The University of Halle (Universität Halle) was founded in 1694 by Frederick III, Elector of Brandenburg, who became Frederick I, King in Prussia, in 1701.
Christian Thomasius was at the same time the first philosopher in Germany to hold his lectures not in Latin, but German.
He contributed to a rational programme in philosophy but also tried to establish a more common-sense point of view, which was aimed against the unquestioned superiority of aristocracy and theology.
The town of Wittenberg was granted to Prussia in the Congress of Vienna in 1815, and the university was then merged with the Prussian University of Halle in 1817.
Others were shifted to Halle-Wittenberg from universities regarded as "better" at the time, which led to the university being called an academic Vorkuta – after the largest center of the Gulag camps in European Russia).
Cooperating research institutions[edit]  MLU's Lions' Hall ("Löwengebäude"), decorated with neoclassical frescos.
The university choir regularly performs at the international Handel Festival in George Frideric Handel’s birthplace, Halle.
In addition, the choir was awarded one of three special awards for the best interpretation of the compulsory piece "As Torrents in Summer" by Edward Elgar.

Jump up ^ Due to rather homogeneous standards of teaching and research, German university rankings generally are far less significant than for many other countries.
Nevertheless, for example, MLU’s faculty of economics outranks University of Heidelberg, the oldest (and often considered as the foremost) German university, in 13 of 19 tested categories, according to the 2007 survey of German Academic Exchange Service.
